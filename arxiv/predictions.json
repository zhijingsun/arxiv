        "abstract": "Visual art (VA) recommendation is complex, as it has to consider the interests of users (e.g. museum visitors) and other stakeholders (e.g. museum curators). We study how to effectively account for key stakeholders in VA recommendations while also considering user-centred measures such as novelty, serendipity, and diversity. We propose MOSAIC, a novel multimodal multistakeholder-aware approach using state-of-the-art CLIP and BLIP backbone architectures and two joint optimisation objectives: popularity and representative selection of paintings across different categories. We conducted an offline evaluation using preferences elicited from 213 users followed by a user study with 100 crowdworkers. We found a strong effect of popularity, which was positively perceived by users, and a minimal effect of representativeness. MOSAIC's impact extends beyond visitors, benefiting various art stakeholders. Its user-centric approach has broader applicability, offering advancements for content recommendation across domains that require considering multiple stakeholders.",

Current state-of-the-art biencoders are trained using an expensive training regime involving knowledge distillation from a teacher model and batch-sampling. Instead of relying on a teacher model, we contribute a novel parameter-free loss function for self-supervision that exploits the pre-trained language modeling capabilities of the encoder model as a training signal, eliminating the need for batch sampling by performing implicit hard negative mining. We investigate the capabilities of our proposed approach through extensive ablation studies, demonstrating that self-distillation can match the effectiveness of teacher distillation using only 13.5% of the data, while offering a speedup in training time between 3x and 15x compared to parametrized losses.

        "abstract": "Generative retrieval (GR) has emerged as a transformative paradigm in search and recommender systems, leveraging numeric-based identifier representations to enhance efficiency and generalization. Notably, methods like TIGER employing Residual Quantization-based Semantic Identifiers (RQ-SID), have shown significant promise in e-commerce scenarios by effectively managing item IDs. However, a critical issue termed the \"\\textbf{Hourglass}\" phenomenon, occurs in RQ-SID, where intermediate codebook tokens become overly concentrated, hindering the full utilization of generative retrieval methods. This paper analyses and addresses this problem by identifying data sparsity and long-tailed distribution as the primary causes. Through comprehensive experiments and detailed ablation studies, we analyze the impact of these factors on codebook utilization and data distribution. Our findings reveal that the \"Hourglass\" phenomenon substantially impacts the performance of RQ-SID in generative retrieval. We propose effective solutions to mitigate this issue, thereby significantly enhancing the effectiveness of generative retrieval in real-world E-commerce applications.",

Given two clusterings, namely a Baseline clustering and an Experiment clustering, the tasks are twofold: 1) characterize their differences, and 2) determine which clustering is better. ABCDE is a novel evaluation technique for accomplishing that. It aims to be practical: it allows items to have associated importance values that are application-specific, it is frugal in its use of human judgements when determining which clustering is better, and it can report metrics for arbitrary slices of items, thereby facilitating understanding and debugging. The approach to measuring the delta in the clustering quality is novel: instead of trying to construct an expensive ground truth up front and evaluating the each clustering with respect to that, where the ground truth must effectively pre-anticipate clustering changes, ABCDE samples questions for judgement on the basis of the actual diffs between the clusterings. ABCDE builds upon the pointwise metrics for clustering evaluation, which make the ABCDE metrics intuitive and simple to understand. The mathematical elegance of the pointwise metrics equip ABCDE with rigorous yet practical ways to explore the clustering diffs and to estimate the quality delta.",

These systems have applications in diverse domains, such as news feeds, game suggestions, and shopping recommendations. Personalization is a key technique in RecSys, where modern methods leverage representation learning to encode user/item interactions into embeddings, forming the foundation for personalized recommendations. However, integrating information from multiple sources to enhance recommendation performance remains challenging. This paper introduces a novel approach named PMTRec, the first personalized multi-task learning algorithm to obtain comprehensive user/item embeddings from various information sources. Addressing challenges specific to personalized RecSys, we develop modules to handle personalized task weights, diverse task orientations, and variations in gradient magnitudes across tasks. PMTRec dynamically adjusts task weights based on gradient norms for each user/item, employs a Task Focusing module to align gradient combinations with the main recommendation task, and uses a Gradient Magnitude Balancing module to ensure balanced training across tasks. Through extensive experiments on three real-world datasets with different scales, we demonstrate that PMTRec significantly outperforms existing multi-task learning methods, showcasing its effectiveness in achieving enhanced recommendation accuracy by leveraging multiple tasks simultaneously.

To save the memory of building the database and maintain accuracy simultaneously, we proposed a new approach combining a streaming algorithm and k-means cluster with RAG. Our approach applies a streaming algorithm to update the index and reduce memory consumption. Then use the k-means algorithm to cluster documents with high similarities together, the query time will be shortened by doing this. We conducted comparative experiments on four methods, and the results show that RAG with streaming algorithm and k-means cluster performs well in accuracy and memory.

        "abstract": "Sequential recommendation is a task to capture hidden user preferences from historical user item interaction data. Significant progress has been made in this domain by leveraging classification based learning methods. Inspired by the recent paradigm of 'pretrain, prompt and predict' in NLP, we consider sequential recommendation as a sequence to sequence generation task and propose a novel model named Generative Recommendation (GenRec). Unlike classification based models that learn explicit user and item representations, GenRec utilizes the sequence modeling capability of Transformer and adopts the masked item prediction objective to effectively learn the hidden bidirectional sequential patterns. Different from existing generative sequential recommendation models, GenRec does not rely on manually designed hard prompts. The input to GenRec is textual user item sequence and the output is top ranked next items. Moreover, GenRec is lightweight and requires only a few hours to train effectively in low-resource settings, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios and helping to democratize large language models in the sequential recommendation domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that GenRec generalizes on various public real-world datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results. Our experiments also validate the effectiveness of the the proposed masked item prediction objective that improves the model performance by a large margin.",

However, the integrity of these systems is constantly challenged by malicious actors seeking to steal their underlying models. Safeguarding against such threats is paramount to upholding the rights and interests of the model owner. While model watermarking has emerged as a potent defense mechanism in various domains, its direct application to recommender systems remains unexplored and non-trivial. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing Autoregressive Out-of-distribution Watermarking (AOW), a novel technique tailored specifically for recommender systems. Our approach entails selecting an initial item and querying it through the oracle model, followed by the selection of subsequent items with small prediction scores. This iterative process generates a watermark sequence autoregressively, which is then ingrained into the model's memory through training. To assess the efficacy of the watermark, the model is tasked with predicting the subsequent item given a truncated watermark sequence. Through extensive experimentation and analysis, we demonstrate the superior performance and robust properties of AOW. Notably, our watermarking technique exhibits high-confidence extraction capabilities and maintains effectiveness even in the face of distillation and fine-tuning processes.",

        "abstract": "Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is an emerging information extraction (IE) task, aiming to simultaneously extract entity spans, types, and entity-matched bounding box groundings in images from given sentence-image pairs data. Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension (MRC-based) frameworks or sequence generation-based models face challenges in understanding the relationships of multimodal entities. MRC-based frameworks, utilizing human-designed queries, struggle to model intra-entity connections. Meanwhile, sequence generation-based outputs excessively rely on inter-entity dependencies due to pre-defined decoding order. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN consists of a Multi-grained Query Set (MQS) and a Multimodal Set Prediction Network (MSP). MQS combines specific type-grained and learnable entity-grained queries to adaptively strengthen intra-entity connections by explicitly aligning visual regions with textual spans. Based on solid intra-entity modeling, MSP reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, enabling the parallel prediction of multimodal entities in a non-autoregressive manner, eliminating redundant dependencies from preceding sequences, and guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a global matching perspective. Additionally, to boost better alignment of two-level relationships, we also incorporate a Query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) to work as a glue network between MQS and MSP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks. Notably, our method improves 2.83% F1 in the difficult fine-grained GMNER benchmark.",

In particular, by leveraging human judgements on the binary choice of adaptive augmentation, we develop RAGate, a gating model, which models conversation context and relevant inputs to predict if a conversational system requires RAG for improved responses. We conduct extensive experiments on devising and applying RAGate to conversational models and well-rounded analyses of different conversational scenarios. Our experimental results and analysis indicate the effective application of RAGate in RAG-based conversational systems in identifying system responses for appropriate RAG with high-quality responses and a high generation confidence.

However, mainstream model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods lack the ability to proactively envision future scenarios, plan, and guide strategies. These methods typically rely on trial and error to adjust policy functions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards or long-term value, even if such high-reward decisions place the environment in extremely dangerous states. To address this, we propose the Prospective (ProSpec) RL method, which makes higher-value, lower-risk optimal decisions by imagining future n-stream trajectories. Specifically, ProSpec employs a dynamic model to predict future states (termed \"imagined states\") based on the current state and a series of sampled actions. Furthermore, we integrate the concept of Model Predictive Control and introduce a cycle consistency constraint that allows the agent to evaluate and select the optimal actions from these trajectories. Moreover, ProSpec employs cycle consistency to mitigate two fundamental issues in RL: augmenting state reversibility to avoid irreversible events (low risk) and augmenting actions to generate numerous virtual trajectories, thereby improving data efficiency. We validated the effectiveness of our method on the DMControl benchmarks, where our approach achieved significant performance improvements. Code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.",

Modular RAG transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms.

However, there is a prevailing concern that sellers often post fake or spam reviews to deceive potential customers and manipulate their opinions about a product.

Unfortunately, the decisions made by complex ML and DL models - which often function as \\emph{black-boxes} - can be surprising and difficult for general users to comprehend. In this paper, we propose an explainable framework for detecting fake reviews with high precision in identifying fraudulent content with explanations and investigate what information matters most for explaining particular decisions by conducting empirical user evaluation. Initially, we develop fake review detection models using DL and transformer models including XLNet and DistilBERT. We then introduce layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique for generating explanations that can map the contributions of words toward the predicted class.

Therefore, we believe it is time to provide a comprehensive review of the progress and future prospects of TDA, with a particular emphasis on the trending generative AI.

        "abstract": "We introduce MoMa, a novel modality-aware mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture designed for pre-training mixed-modal, early-fusion language models. MoMa processes images and text in arbitrary sequences by dividing expert modules into modality-specific groups. These groups exclusively process designated tokens while employing learned routing within each group to maintain semantically informed adaptivity. Our empirical results reveal substantial pre-training efficiency gains through this modality-specific parameter allocation. Under a 1-trillion-token training budget, the MoMa 1.4B model, featuring 4 text experts and 4 image experts, achieves impressive FLOPs savings: 3.7x overall, with 2.6x for text and 5.2x for image processing compared to a compute-equivalent dense baseline, measured by pre-training loss. This outperforms the standard expert-choice MoE with 8 mixed-modal experts, which achieves 3x overall FLOPs savings (3x for text, 2.8x for image). Combining MoMa with mixture-of-depths (MoD) further improves pre-training FLOPs savings to 4.2x overall (text: 3.4x, image: 5.3x), although this combination hurts performance in causal inference due to increased sensitivity to router accuracy. These results demonstrate MoMa's potential to significantly advance the efficiency of mixed-modal, early-fusion language model pre-training, paving the way for more resource-efficient and capable multimodal AI systems.",

A representative local search solver for PBO is LSPBO. In this paper, firstly, we improve LSPBO by a dynamic scoring mechanism, which dynamically strikes a balance between score on hard constraints and score on the objective function.\nMoreover, on top of this improved LSPBO , we develop the first parallel local search PBO solver. The main idea is to share good solutions among different threads to guide the search, by maintaining a pool of feasible solutions. For evaluating solutions when updating the pool, we propose a function that considers both the solution quality and the diversity of the pool. Furthermore, we calculate the polarity density in the pool to enhance the scoring function of local search. Our empirical experiments show clear benefits of the proposed parallel approach, making it competitive with the parallel version of the famous commercial solver Gurobi.",

        "abstract": "The abundance of intestinal flora is closely related to human diseases, but diseases are not caused by a single gut microbe. Instead, they result from the complex interplay of numerous microbial entities. This intricate and implicit connection among gut microbes poses a significant challenge for disease prediction using abundance information from OTU data. Recently, several methods have shown potential in predicting corresponding diseases. However, these methods fail to learn the inner association among gut microbes from different hosts, leading to unsatisfactory performance. In this paper, we present a novel architecture, Unsupervised Multi-graph Merge Adversarial Network (UMMAN). UMMAN can obtain the embeddings of nodes in the Multi-Graph in an unsupervised scenario, so that it helps learn the multiplex association. Our method is the first to combine Graph Neural Network with the task of intestinal flora disease prediction. We employ complex relation-types to construct the Original-Graph and disrupt the relationships among nodes to generate corresponding Shuffled-Graph. We introduce the Node Feature Global Integration (NFGI) module to represent the global features of the graph. Furthermore, we design a joint loss comprising adversarial loss and hybrid attention loss to ensure that the real graph embedding aligns closely with the Original-Graph and diverges from the Shuffled-Graph. Comprehensive experiments on five classical OTU gut microbiome datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and stability of our method. (We will release our code soon.)",

By combining ontological knowledge and the language understanding capabilities of LLMs, we achieve high precision and recall rates in identifying both the chemical entities and roles in scientific literature.

This static nature hampers their ability to provide accurate, up-to-date responses, particularly in dynamic or rapidly evolving contexts. Integrating Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation (Multimodal RAG) offers a promising solution, but the system would inevitably encounter the multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) problem, which involves two types of noise: coarse-grained (query-caption) and fine-grained (query-image).

        "abstract": "Time series forecasting (TSF) is immensely important in extensive applications, such as electricity transformation, financial trade, medical monitoring, and smart agriculture. Although Transformer-based methods can handle time series data, their ability to predict long-term time series is limited due to the ``anti-order\" nature of the self-attention mechanism. To address this problem, we focus on frequency domain to weaken the impact of order in TSF and propose the FreqBlock, where we first obtain frequency representations through the Frequency Transform Module. Subsequently, a newly designed Frequency Cross Attention is used to obtian enhanced frequency representations between the real and imaginary parts, thus establishing a link between the attention mechanism and the inherent Kramer-Kronig relations (KKRs). Our backbone network, FreqTSF, adopts a residual structure by concatenating multiple FreqBlocks to simulate KKRs in the frequency domain and avoid degradation problems. On a theoretical level, we demonstrate that the proposed two modules can significantly reduce the time and memory complexity from $\\mathcal{O}(L^2)$ to $\\mathcal{O}(L)$ for each FreqBlock computation. Empirical studies on four benchmark datasets show that FreqTSF achieves an overall relative MSE reduction of 15\\% and an overall relative MAE reduction of 11\\% compared to the state-of-the-art methods. The code will be available soon.",

        "abstract": "The presence of hyperreflective foci (HFs) is related to retinal disease progression, and the quantity has proven to be a prognostic factor of visual and anatomical outcome in various retinal diseases. However, lack of efficient quantitative tools for evaluating the HFs has deprived ophthalmologist of assessing the volume of HFs. For this reason, we propose an automated quantification algorithm to segment and quantify HFs in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The proposed algorithm consists of two parallel processes namely: region of interest (ROI) generation and HFs estimation. To generate the ROI, we use morphological reconstruction to obtain the reconstructed image and histogram constructed for data distributions and clustering. In parallel, we estimate the HFs by extracting the extremal regions from the connected regions obtained from a component tree. Finally, both the ROI and the HFs estimation process are merged to obtain the segmented HFs. The proposed algorithm was tested on 40 3D SD-OCT volumes from 40 patients diagnosed with non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR), proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR), and diabetic macular edema (DME). The average dice similarity coefficient (DSC) and correlation coefficient (r) are 69.70%, 0.99 for NPDR, 70.31%, 0.99 for PDR, and 71.30%, 0.99 for DME, respectively. The proposed algorithm can provide ophthalmologist with good HFs quantitative information, such as volume, size, and location of the HFs.",

        "abstract": "Static noise maps depicting long-term noise levels over wide areas are valuable urban planning assets for municipalities in decreasing noise exposure of residents. However, non-traffic noise sources with transient behavior, which people complain frequently, are usually ignored by static maps. We propose here a dynamic noise mapping approach using the data collected via low-power wide-area network (LPWAN, specifically LoRaWAN) based internet of things (IoT) infrastructure, which is one of the most common communication backbones for smart cities. Noise mapping based on LPWAN is challenging due to the low data rates of these protocols. The proposed dynamic noise mapping approach diminishes the negative implications of data rate limitations using machine learning (ML) for event and location prediction of non-traffic sources based on the scarce data. The strength of these models lies in their consideration of the spatial variance in acoustic behavior caused by the buildings in urban settings. The effectiveness of the proposed method and the accuracy of the resulting dynamic maps are evaluated in field tests. The results show that the proposed system can decrease the map error caused by non-traffic sources up to 51% and can stay effective under significant packet losses.",

AI systems, even carefully designed to be fair, are heavily criticized for delivering misjudged and discriminated outcomes against individuals and groups. Numerous work on AI algorithmic fairness is devoted on Machine Learning pipelines which address biases and quantify fairness under a pure computational view. However, the continuous unfair and unjust AI outcomes, indicate that there is urgent need to understand AI as a sociotechnical system, inseparable from the conditions in which it is designed, developed and deployed. Although, the synergy of humans and machines seems imperative to make AI work, the significant impact of human and societal factors on AI bias is currently overlooked. We address this critical issue by following a radical new methodology under which human cognitive biases become core entities in our AI fairness overview. Inspired by the cognitive science definition and taxonomy of human heuristics, we identify how harmful human actions influence the overall AI lifecycle, and reveal human to AI biases hidden pathways. We introduce a new mapping, which justifies the human heuristics to AI biases reflections and we detect relevant fairness intensities and inter-dependencies. We envision that this approach will contribute in revisiting AI fairness under deeper human-centric case studies, revealing hidden biases cause and effects.",

To address these issues, we conduct a comprehensive meta-analysis of AI safety benchmarks, empirically analyzing their correlation with general capabilities across dozens of models and providing a survey of existing directions in AI safety. Our findings reveal that many safety benchmarks highly correlate with upstream model capabilities, potentially enabling \"safetywashing\" -- where capability improvements are misrepresented as safety advancements.

However, when it comes to inference, we often limit the amount of compute to only one attempt per problem. Here, we explore inference compute as another axis for scaling by increasing the number of generated samples. Across multiple tasks and models, we observe that coverage - the fraction of problems solved by any attempt - scales with the number of samples over four orders of magnitude. In domains like coding and formal proofs, where all answers can be automatically verified, these increases in coverage directly translate into improved performance. When we apply repeated sampling to SWE-bench Lite, the fraction of issues solved with DeepSeek-V2-Coder-Instruct increases from 15.9% with one sample to 56% with 250 samples, outperforming the single-attempt state-of-the-art of 43% which uses more capable frontier models. Moreover, using current API pricing, amplifying the cheaper DeepSeek model with five samples is more cost-effective and solves more issues than paying a premium for one sample from GPT-4o or Claude 3.5 Sonnet. Interestingly, the relationship between coverage and the number of samples is often log-linear and can be modelled with an exponentiated power law, suggesting the existence of inference-time scaling laws. Finally, we find that identifying correct samples out of many generations remains an important direction for future research in domains without automatic verifiers. When solving math word problems from GSM8K and MATH, coverage with Llama-3 models grows to over 95% with 10,000 samples.

        "abstract": "Adapting foundation models for medical image analysis requires finetuning them on a considerable amount of data because of extreme distribution shifts between natural (source) data used for pretraining and medical (target) data. However, collecting task-specific medical data for such finetuning at a central location raises many privacy concerns. Although Federated learning (FL) provides an effective means for training on private decentralized data, communication costs in federating large foundation models can quickly become a significant bottleneck, impacting the solution's scalability. In this work, we address this problem of efficient communication while ensuring effective learning in FL by combining the strengths of Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) with FL. Specifically, we study plug-and-play Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) in a federated manner to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for 3D medical image segmentation. Unlike prior works that utilize LoRA and finetune the entire decoder, we critically analyze the contribution of each granular component of SAM on finetuning performance. Thus, we identify specific layers to be federated that are very efficient in terms of communication cost while producing on-par accuracy. Our experiments show that retaining the parameters of the SAM model (including most of the decoder) in their original state during adaptation is beneficial because fine-tuning on small datasets tends to distort the inherent capabilities of the underlying foundation model. On Fed-KiTS, our approach decreases communication cost (~48x) compared to full fine-tuning while increasing performance (~6% Dice score) in 3D segmentation tasks. Our approach performs similar to SAMed while achieving ~2.8x reduction in communication and parameters to be finetuned.

We study 7 SSL approaches based on reconstruction, contrastive loss, distillation, and information theory and evaluate them extensively on a large private US dataset. Our observations and findings are consolidated from more than 500 downstream training experiments under different settings. Our primary observation shows that for SSL training, the variance of the dataset is more crucial than its size because it allows the model to learn generalisable representations, which improve the performance of downstream tasks. Overall, the BarlowTwins method shows robust performance, irrespective of the training settings and data variations, when used as an initialisation for downstream tasks. Notably, full fine-tuning with 1% of labelled data outperforms ImageNet initialisation by 12% in F1-score and outperforms other SSL initialisations by at least 4% in F1-score, thus making it a promising candidate for transfer learning from US video to image data.",

In this paper, we introduce a new task: open-vocabulary audio-visual semantic segmentation, extending AVSS task to open-world scenarios beyond the annotated label space. This is a more challenging task that requires recognizing all categories, even those that have never been seen nor heard during training. Moreover, we propose the first open-vocabulary AVSS framework, OV-AVSS, which mainly consists of two parts: 1) a universal sound source localization module to perform audio-visual fusion and locate all potential sounding objects and 2) an open-vocabulary classification module to predict categories with the help of the prior knowledge from large-scale pre-trained vision-language models.

Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong segmentation and zero-shot generalization ability of our model on all categories.

However, its inherent statistical characteristics can significantly impact downstream tasks, potentially compromising deployment performance. In this study, we empirically investigate this issue and uncover a critical phenomenon: downstream neural networks often exploit spurious distinctions between real and synthetic data when there is a strong correlation between the data source and the task label. This exploitation manifests as \\textit{simplicity bias}, where models overly rely on superficial features rather than genuine task-related complexities. Through principled experiments, we demonstrate that the source of data (real vs.\\ synthetic) can introduce spurious correlating factors leading to poor performance during deployment when the correlation is absent. We first demonstrate this vulnerability on a digit classification task, where the model spuriously utilizes the source of data instead of the digit to provide an inference. We provide further evidence of this phenomenon in a medical imaging problem related to cardiac view classification in echocardiograms, particularly distinguishing between 2-chamber and 4-chamber views.

This is unacceptable if deep learning is to continue advancing. Therefore, this paper proposes a deep learning parallelization strategy based on the Universal Approximation Theorem (UAT). From this foundation, we designed a parallel network called Para-Former to test our theory. Unlike traditional serial models, the inference time of Para-Former does not increase with the number of layers, significantly accelerating the inference speed of multi-layer networks.

        "abstract": "Early detection of drought stress is critical for taking timely measures for reducing crop loss before the drought impact becomes irreversible. The subtle phenotypical and physiological changes in response to drought stress are captured by non-invasive imaging techniques and these imaging data serve as valuable resource for machine learning methods to identify drought stress. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are in wide use, vision transformers (ViTs) present a promising alternative in capturing long-range dependencies and intricate spatial relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle indicators of drought stress. We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress. Our key findings explain the ViT model's decision-making process by visualizing attention maps. These maps highlight the specific spatial features within the aerial images that the ViT model focuses as the drought stress signature. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed methods not only achieve high accuracy in drought stress identification but also shedding light on the diverse subtle plant features associated with drought stress. This offers a robust and interpretable solution for drought stress monitoring for farmers to undertake informed decisions for improved crop management.",

Traditional assessment methods often rely on extrinsic variables, such as performance in downstream tasks, which can introduce confounding factors and mask the true quality of embeddings. This paper introduces the Intrinsic Distance Preservation Evaluation (IDPE) method, a novel approach for assessing embedding quality based on the preservation of Mahalanobis distances between data points in the original and embedded spaces. We demonstrate the limitations of extrinsic evaluation methods through a simple example, highlighting how they can lead to misleading conclusions about embedding quality. IDPE addresses these issues by providing a task-independent measure of how well embeddings preserve the intrinsic structure of the original data. Our method leverages efficient similarity search techniques to make it applicable to large-scale datasets. We compare IDPE with established intrinsic metrics like trustworthiness and continuity, as well as extrinsic metrics such as Average Rank and Mean Reciprocal Rank. Our results show that IDPE offers a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of embedding quality across various scenarios. We evaluate PCA and t-SNE embeddings using IDPE, revealing insights into their performance that are not captured by traditional metrics. This work contributes to the field by providing a robust, efficient, and interpretable method for embedding evaluation.

Simply fine-tuning on new datasets results in \"catastrophic forgetting\", and cannot adapt to variations of view labels between sites. Alternatively, collecting all data on a single server and re-training may not be feasible as data sharing agreements may restrict image transfer, or datasets may only become available at different times. Furthermore, time and cost associated with re-training grows with every new dataset. We propose a class-incremental learning method which learns an expert network for each dataset, and combines all expert networks with a score fusion model. The influence of ``unqualified experts'' is minimised by weighting each contribution with a learnt in-distribution score. These weights promote transparency as the contribution of each expert is known during inference. Instead of using the original images, we use learned features from each dataset, which are easier to share and raise fewer licensing and privacy concerns.

Skeleton-based Human Activity Recognition has received much attention in recent years, where Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based method is widely used and has achieved remarkable results. However, the representation of skeleton data and the issue of over-smoothing in GCN still need to be studied. 1). Compared to central nodes, edge nodes can only aggregate limited neighbor information, and different edge nodes of the human body are always structurally related. However, the information from edge nodes is crucial for fine-grained activity recognition. 2). The Graph Convolutional Network suffers from a significant over-smoothing issue, causing nodes to become increasingly similar as the number of network layers increases. Based on these two ideas, we propose a two-stream graph convolution method called Spatial-Structural GCN (SpSt-GCN). Spatial GCN performs information aggregation based on the topological structure of the human body, and structural GCN performs differentiation based on the similarity of edge node sequences. The spatial connection is fixed, and the human skeleton naturally maintains this topology regardless of the actions performed by humans. However, the structural connection is dynamic and depends on the type of movement the human body is performing. Based on this idea, we also propose an entirely data-driven structural connection, which greatly increases flexibility.

Contemporary research underscores the importance of precisely predicting myopia progression to enable timely and effective interventions, thereby averting severe visual impairment in children. Such predictions predominantly rely on subjective clinical assessments, which are inherently biased and resource-intensive, thus hindering their widespread application. In this study, we introduce a novel, high-accuracy method for quantitatively predicting the myopic trajectory and myopia risk in children using only fundus images and baseline refraction data. This approach was validated through a six-year longitudinal study of 3,408 children in Henan, utilizing 16,211 fundus images and corresponding refractive data.

Training such models requires large high quality data sets. And deploying these models to low power devices requires novel compression techniques and model architectures. While species classification methods have profited from novel data sets and advances in ML methods, in particular neural networks, deploying these state of the art models to low power devices remains difficult. Here we present a comprehensive empirical comparison of various tinyML neural network architectures and compression techniques for species classification. We focus on the example of bird song detection, more concretely a data set curated for studying the corn bunting bird species. The data set is released along with all code and experiments of this study. In our experiments we compare predictive performance, memory and time complexity of classical spectrogram based methods and recent approaches operating on raw audio signal. Our results indicate that individual bird species can be robustly detected with relatively simple architectures that can be readily deployed to low power devices.",

        "abstract": "Despite large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various tasks, they are still suffering from the factual inconsistency problem called hallucinations. For instance, LLMs occasionally generate content that diverges from source article, and prefer to extract information that appears at the beginning and end of the context, especially in long document summarization. Inspired by these findings, we propose to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in summarization by impelling them to process the entire article more fairly and faithfully. We present a novel summary generation strategy, namely SliSum, which exploits the ideas of sliding windows and self-consistency. Specifically, SliSum divides the source article into overlapping windows, and utilizes LLM to generate local summaries for the content in the windows. Finally, SliSum aggregates all local summaries using clustering and majority voting algorithm to produce more faithful summary of entire article. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SliSum significantly improves the faithfulness of diverse LLMs including LLaMA-2, Claude-2 and GPT-3.5 in both short and long text summarization, while maintaining their fluency and informativeness and without additional fine-tuning and resources. We further conduct qualitative and quantitative studies to investigate why SliSum works and impacts of hyperparameters in SliSum on performance.",

Our approach innovatively incorporates a differential deformation kernel, which deconstructs the generation of geometric structures into successive non-rigid deformation stages. By leveraging a probabilistic diffusion model to simulate this step-by-step process, our method provides a versatile and efficient solution for a wide range of applications, spanning from graphics rendering to facial expression animation. Empirical evidence highlights the effectiveness of our approach, demonstrating state-of-the-art performance in point cloud generation and competitive results in mesh deformation.

In this work, we address several challenges for post-hoc hallucination detection in production settings. Our pipeline for hallucination detection entails: first, producing a confidence score representing the likelihood that a generated answer is a hallucination; second, calibrating the score conditional on attributes of the inputs and candidate response; finally, performing detection by thresholding the calibrated score. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making. Based on findings that no individual score performs best in all situations, we propose a multi-scoring framework, which combines different scores and achieves top performance across all datasets. We further introduce cost-effective multi-scoring, which can match or even outperform more expensive detection methods, while significantly reducing computational overhead.",

        "abstract": "Document-level relation extraction (DocRE) aims to extract relations between entities from unstructured document text. Compared to sentence-level relation extraction, it requires more complex semantic understanding from a broader text context. Currently, some studies are utilizing logical rules within evidence sentences to enhance the performance of DocRE. However, in the data without provided evidence sentences, researchers often obtain a list of evidence sentences for the entire document through evidence retrieval (ER). Therefore, DocRE suffers from two challenges: firstly, the relevance between evidence and entity pairs is weak; secondly, there is insufficient extraction of complex cross-relations between long-distance multi-entities. To overcome these challenges, we propose GEGA, a novel model for DocRE. The model leverages graph neural networks to construct multiple weight matrices, guiding attention allocation to evidence sentences. It also employs multi-scale representation aggregation to enhance ER. Subsequently, we integrate the most efficient evidence information to implement both fully supervised and weakly supervised training processes for the model. We evaluate the GEGA model on three widely used benchmark datasets: DocRED, Re-DocRED, and Revisit-DocRED.

Although demonstrating satisfactory performance on medical Visual Question Answering (VQA) tasks, Medical LVLMs (MLVLMs) suffer from the hallucination problem, which makes them fail to diagnose complex pathologies. Moreover, they readily fail to learn minority pathologies due to imbalanced training data. We propose two prompting strategies for MLVLMs that reduce hallucination and improve VQA performance.

Tested on the MIMIC-CXR-JPG and Chexpert datasets, our methods significantly improve the diagnostic F1 score, with the highest increase being 0.27.

However, mainstream model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) methods lack the ability to proactively envision future scenarios, plan, and guide strategies. These methods typically rely on trial and error to adjust policy functions, aiming to maximize cumulative rewards or long-term value, even if such high-reward decisions place the environment in extremely dangerous states. To address this, we propose the Prospective (ProSpec) RL method, which makes higher-value, lower-risk optimal decisions by imagining future n-stream trajectories. Specifically, ProSpec employs a dynamic model to predict future states (termed \"imagined states\") based on the current state and a series of sampled actions. Furthermore, we integrate the concept of Model Predictive Control and introduce a cycle consistency constraint that allows the agent to evaluate and select the optimal actions from these trajectories. Moreover, ProSpec employs cycle consistency to mitigate two fundamental issues in RL: augmenting state reversibility to avoid irreversible events (low risk) and augmenting actions to generate numerous virtual trajectories, thereby improving data efficiency. We validated the effectiveness of our method on the DMControl benchmarks, where our approach achieved significant performance improvements. Code will be open-sourced upon acceptance.",

        "abstract": "Vision-based industrial inspection (VII) aims to locate defects quickly and accurately. Supervised learning under a close-set setting and industrial anomaly detection, as two common paradigms in VII, face different problems in practical applications. The former is that various and sufficient defects are difficult to obtain, while the latter is that specific defects cannot be located. To solve these problems, in this paper, we focus on the few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) method, which can locate unseen defects conditioned on a few annotations without retraining. Compared to common objects in natural images, the defects in VII are small. This brings two problems to current FSS methods: 1 distortion of target semantics and 2 many false positives for backgrounds. To alleviate these problems, we propose a small object few-shot segmentation (SOFS) model. The key idea for alleviating 1 is to avoid the resizing of the original image and correctly indicate the intensity of target semantics. SOFS achieves this idea via the non-resizing procedure and the prototype intensity downsampling of support annotations. To alleviate 2, we design an abnormal prior map in SOFS to guide the model to reduce false positives and propose a mixed normal Dice loss to preferentially prevent the model from predicting false positives. SOFS can achieve FSS and few-shot anomaly detection determined by support masks. Diverse experiments substantiate the superior performance of SOFS. Code is available at this https URL.",

Many models have been developed to tackle this problem, and recently vision transformers (ViTs) have shown promising results. However, the complexity and large number of trainable parameters of ViTs restrict their deployment in practical applications. This underscores the need for an efficient model that not only reduces trainable parameters but also allows for adjustable complexity based on specific needs while delivering comparable performance. To achieve this, in this paper we introduce an Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (EUDA) framework. EUDA employs the DINOv2, which is a self-supervised ViT, as a feature extractor followed by a simplified bottleneck of fully connected layers to refine features for enhanced domain adaptation. Additionally, EUDA employs the synergistic domain alignment loss (SDAL), which integrates cross-entropy (CE) and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) losses, to balance adaptation by minimizing classification errors in the source domain while aligning the source and target domain distributions. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of EUDA in producing comparable results as compared with other state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation with significantly fewer trainable parameters, between 42% to 99.7% fewer.

        "abstract": "Discrete diffusion modeling is a promising framework for modeling and generating data in discrete spaces. To sample from these models, different strategies present trade-offs between computation and sample quality. A predominant sampling strategy is predictor-corrector $\\tau$-leaping, which simulates the continuous time generative process with discretized predictor steps and counteracts the accumulation of discretization error via corrector steps. However, for absorbing state diffusion, an important class of discrete diffusion models, the standard forward-backward corrector can be ineffective in fixing such errors, resulting in subpar sample quality. To remedy this problem, we propose a family of informed correctors that more reliably counteracts discretization error by leveraging information learned by the model. For further efficiency gains, we also propose $k$-Gillespie's, a sampling algorithm that better utilizes each model evaluation, while still enjoying the speed and flexibility of $\\tau$-leaping. Across several real and synthetic datasets, we show that $k$-Gillespie's with informed correctors reliably produces higher quality samples at lower computational cost.",

The individual cores can be digitally extracted and then linked to metadata for analysis in a process known as de-arraying. However, TMAs often contain core misalignments and artifacts due to assembly errors, which can adversely affect the reliability of the extracted cores during the de-arraying process.

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising potential in Software Engineering, especially for code-related tasks like code completion and code generation. LLMs' evaluation is generally centred around general metrics computed over benchmarks. While painting a macroscopic view of the benchmarks and of the LLMs' capacity, it is unclear how each programming task in these benchmarks assesses the capabilities of the LLMs. In particular, the difficulty level of the tasks in the benchmarks is not reflected in the score used to report the performance of the model. Yet, a model achieving a 90% score on a benchmark of predominantly easy tasks is likely less capable than a model achieving a 90% score on a benchmark containing predominantly difficult tasks. This paper devises a framework, HardEval, for assessing task difficulty for LLMs and crafting new tasks based on identified hard tasks. The framework uses a diverse array of prompts for a single task across multiple LLMs to obtain a difficulty score for each task of a benchmark. Using two code generation benchmarks, HumanEval+ and ClassEval, we show that HardEval can reliably identify the hard tasks within those benchmarks, highlighting that only 21% of HumanEval+ and 27% of ClassEval tasks are hard for LLMs. Through our analysis of task difficulty, we also characterize 6 practical hard task topics which we used to generate new hard tasks. Orthogonal to current benchmarking evaluation efforts, HardEval can assist researchers and practitioners in fostering better assessments of LLMs. The difficulty score can be used to identify hard tasks within existing benchmarks. This, in turn, can be leveraged to generate more hard tasks centred around specific topics either for evaluation or improvement of LLMs. HardEval generalistic approach can be applied to other domains such as code completion or Q/A.",

Significant progress has been made in this domain by leveraging classification based learning methods. Inspired by the recent paradigm of 'pretrain, prompt and predict' in NLP, we consider sequential recommendation as a sequence to sequence generation task and propose a novel model named Generative Recommendation (GenRec). Unlike classification based models that learn explicit user and item representations, GenRec utilizes the sequence modeling capability of Transformer and adopts the masked item prediction objective to effectively learn the hidden bidirectional sequential patterns. Different from existing generative sequential recommendation models, GenRec does not rely on manually designed hard prompts. The input to GenRec is textual user item sequence and the output is top ranked next items. Moreover, GenRec is lightweight and requires only a few hours to train effectively in low-resource settings, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios and helping to democratize large language models in the sequential recommendation domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that GenRec generalizes on various public real-world datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results.

Significant effort has been made to deviate from conventional Von Neumann architectures. In-memory computing has emerged in the field of electronics as a possible solution to the infamous bottleneck between memory and computing processors, which reduces the effective throughput of data. In photonics, novel schemes attempt to collocate the computing processor and memory in a single device. Photonics offers the flexibility of multiplexing streams of data not only spatially and in time, but also in frequency or, equivalently, in wavelength, which makes it highly suitable for parallel computing. Here, we numerically show the use of time and wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) to solve four independent tasks at the same time in a single photonic chip, serving as a proof of concept for our proposal. The system is a time-delay reservoir computing (TDRC) based on a microring resonator (MRR). The addressed tasks cover different applications: Time-series prediction, waveform signal classification, wireless channel equalization, and radar signal prediction. The system is also tested for simultaneous computing of up to 10 instances of the same task, exhibiting excellent performance. The footprint of the system is reduced by using time-division multiplexing of the nodes that act as the neurons of the studied neural network scheme. WDM is used for the parallelization of wavelength channels, each addressing a single task.

Materials and Methods: We used a DenseNet121 model pretrained MIMIC-CXR dataset for deep learning-based multilabel classification using ground truth labels from radiology reports extracted using the CheXpert and CheXbert Labeler. We compared the performance of the 14 chest X-ray labels on the MIMIC-CXR and Veterans Healthcare Administration chest X-ray dataset (VA-CXR). The VA-CXR dataset comprises over 259k chest X-ray images spanning between the years 2010 and 2022. Results: The validation of ground truth and the assessment of multi-label classification performance across various NLP extraction tools revealed that the VA-CXR dataset exhibited lower disagreement rates than the MIMIC-CXR datasets. Additionally, there were notable differences in AUC scores between models utilizing CheXpert and CheXbert. When evaluating multi-label classification performance across different datasets, minimal domain shift was observed in unseen datasets, except for the label \"Enlarged Cardiomediastinum.\" The study year's subgroup analyses exhibited the most significant variations in multi-label classification model performance. These findings underscore the importance of considering domain shifts in chest X-ray classification tasks, particularly concerning study years.

Hence, Fault Injection (FI) testing is conducted by practitioners to evaluate the safety level of HAVs. To fully cover test cases, various driving scenarios and fault settings should be considered. However, due to numerous combinations of test scenarios and fault settings, the testing space can be complex and high-dimensional. In addition, evaluating performance in all newly added scenarios is resource-consuming. The rarity of critical faults that can cause security problems further strengthens the challenge. To address these challenges, we propose to accelerate FI testing under the low-rank Smoothness Regularized Matrix Factorization (SRMF) framework. We first organize the sparse evaluated data into a structured matrix based on its safety values. Then the untested values are estimated by the correlation captured by the matrix structure. To address high dimensionality, a low-rank constraint is imposed on the testing space. To exploit the relationships between existing scenarios and new scenarios and capture the local regularity of critical faults, three types of smoothness regularization are further designed as a complement. We conduct experiments on car following and cut in scenarios. The results indicate that SRMF has the lowest prediction error in various scenarios and is capable of predicting rare critical faults compared to other machine learning models. In addition, SRMF can achieve 1171 acceleration rate, 99.3% precision and 91.1% F1 score in identifying critical faults.

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning has emerged as a key approach for learning generic representations from speech data. Despite promising results in downstream tasks such as speech recognition, speaker verification, and emotion recognition, a significant number of parameters is required, which makes fine-tuning for each task memory-inefficient. To address this limitation, we introduce ELP-adapter tuning, a novel method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using three types of adapter, namely encoder adapters (E-adapters), layer adapters (L-adapters), and a prompt adapter (P-adapter). The E-adapters are integrated into transformer-based encoder layers and help to learn fine-grained speech representations that are effective for speech recognition. The L-adapters create paths from each encoder layer to the downstream head and help to extract non-linguistic features from lower encoder layers that are effective for speaker verification and emotion recognition. The P-adapter appends pseudo features to CNN features to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. With these adapters, models can be quickly adapted to various speech processing tasks. Our evaluation across four downstream tasks using five backbone models demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method. With the WavLM backbone, its performance was comparable to or better than that of full fine-tuning on all tasks while requiring 90% fewer learnable parameters.",

The recent rapid uptake of building information models (BIM) in the construction industry has created more opportunities for automated compliance checking (ACC). BIM enables sharing of digital building design data that can be used for compliance checking with legal requirements, which are conventionally conveyed in natural language and not intended for machine processing. Creating a computable representation of legal requirements suitable for ACC is complex, costly, and time-consuming. Large language models (LLMs) such as the generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, powering OpenAI's ChatGPT, can generate logically coherent text and source code responding to user prompts. This capability could be used to automate the conversion of building regulations into a semantic and computable representation. This paper evaluates the performance of LLMs in translating building regulations into LegalRuleML in a few-shot learning setup. By providing GPT-3.5 with only a few example translations, it can learn the basic structure of the format. Using a system prompt, we further specify the LegalRuleML representation and explore the existence of expert domain knowledge in the model. Such domain knowledge might be ingrained in GPT-3.5 through the broad pre-training but needs to be brought forth by careful contextualisation. Finally, we investigate whether strategies such as chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency could apply to this use case. As LLMs become more sophisticated, the increased common sense, logical coherence, and means to domain adaptation can significantly support ACC, leading to more efficient and effective checking processes.",

While there have been extensive studies of scaling laws and models' scaling behaviors, the effect of scale on a model's social biases and stereotyping tendencies has received less attention. In this study, we explore the influence of model scale and pre-training data on its learnt social biases. We focus on BERT -- an extremely popular language model -- and investigate biases as they show up during language modeling (upstream), as well as during classification applications after fine-tuning (downstream). Our experiments on four architecture sizes of BERT demonstrate that pre-training data substantially influences how upstream biases evolve with model scale. With increasing scale, models pre-trained on large internet scrapes like Common Crawl exhibit higher toxicity, whereas models pre-trained on moderated data sources like Wikipedia show greater gender stereotypes. However, downstream biases generally decrease with increasing model scale, irrespective of the pre-training data. Our results highlight the qualitative role of pre-training data in the biased behavior of language models, an often overlooked aspect in the study of scale.

To this end, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification of factual correctness in long-form natural language generation. Given some output from a large language model, we study both uncertainty at the level of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and uncertainty across the entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Moreover, we invoke multicalibration and multivalid conformal prediction to ensure that such uncertainty guarantees are valid both marginally and across distinct groups of prompts. Using the task of biography generation, we demonstrate empirically that having access to and making use of additional group attributes for each prompt improves both overall and group-wise performance. As the problems of calibration, conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively explored previously in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these empirical results to form a benchmark for this setting.",

        "abstract": "Empathetic response generation is designed to comprehend the emotions of others and select the most appropriate strategies to assist them in resolving emotional challenges. Empathy can be categorized into cognitive empathy and affective empathy. The former pertains to the ability to understand and discern the emotional issues and situations of others, while the latter involves the capacity to provide comfort. To enhance one's empathetic abilities, it is essential to develop both these aspects. Therefore, we develop an innovative framework that combines retrieval augmentation and emotional support strategy integration. Our framework starts with the introduction of a comprehensive emotional palette for empathy. We then apply appraisal theory to decompose this palette and create a database of empathetic responses. This database serves as an external resource and enhances the LLM's empathy by integrating semantic retrieval mechanisms. Moreover, our framework places a strong emphasis on the proper articulation of response strategies. By incorporating emotional support strategies, we aim to enrich the model's capabilities in both cognitive and affective empathy, leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive empathetic response. Finally, we extract datasets ED and ET from the empathetic dialogue dataset \\textsc{EmpatheticDialogues} and ExTES based on dialogue length. Experiments demonstrate that our framework can enhance the empathy ability of LLMs from both cognitive and affective empathy perspectives. Our code is released at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked interest in their potential applications across various fields. This paper embarked on a pivotal inquiry: Can existing LLMs effectively serve as \"water expert models\" for water engineering and research tasks? This study was the first to evaluate LLMs' contributions across various water engineering and research tasks by establishing a domain-specific benchmark suite, namely, WaterER. Herein, we prepared 983 tasks related to water engineering and research, categorized into \"wastewater treatment\", \"environmental restoration\", \"drinking water treatment and distribution\", \"sanitation\", \"anaerobic digestion\" and \"contaminants assessment\". We evaluated the performance of seven LLMs (i.e., GPT-4, GPT-3.5, Gemini, GLM-4, ERNIE, QWEN and Llama3) on these tasks. We highlighted the strengths of GPT-4 in handling diverse and complex tasks of water engineering and water research, the specialized capabilities of Gemini in academic contexts, Llama3's strongest capacity to answer Chinese water engineering questions and the competitive performance of Chinese-oriented models like GLM-4, ERNIE and QWEN in some water engineering tasks. More specifically, current LLMs excelled particularly in generating precise research gaps for papers on \"contaminants and related water quality monitoring and assessment\". Additionally, they were more adept at creating appropriate titles for research papers on \"treatment processes for wastewaters\", \"environmental restoration\", and \"drinking water treatment\". Overall, this study pioneered evaluating LLMs in water engineering and research by introducing the WaterER benchmark to assess the trustworthiness of their predictions. This standardized evaluation framework would also drive future advancements in LLM technology by using targeting datasets, propelling these models towards becoming true \"water expert\".",

        "abstract": "Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is an emerging information extraction (IE) task, aiming to simultaneously extract entity spans, types, and entity-matched bounding box groundings in images from given sentence-image pairs data. Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension (MRC-based) frameworks or sequence generation-based models face challenges in understanding the relationships of multimodal entities. MRC-based frameworks, utilizing human-designed queries, struggle to model intra-entity connections. Meanwhile, sequence generation-based outputs excessively rely on inter-entity dependencies due to pre-defined decoding order. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN consists of a Multi-grained Query Set (MQS) and a Multimodal Set Prediction Network (MSP). MQS combines specific type-grained and learnable entity-grained queries to adaptively strengthen intra-entity connections by explicitly aligning visual regions with textual spans. Based on solid intra-entity modeling, MSP reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, enabling the parallel prediction of multimodal entities in a non-autoregressive manner, eliminating redundant dependencies from preceding sequences, and guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a global matching perspective. Additionally, to boost better alignment of two-level relationships, we also incorporate a Query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) to work as a glue network between MQS and MSP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks.

The proposed framework can be built upon existing techniques for the same purpose, enhancing their alignment with human judgment. By doing so, we simplify the training objective with a self-distillation-based technique, providing a strong baseline for concept removal.

Recent studies have demonstrated that an adversary could extract highly sensitive privacy data from the training data of LLMs with carefully designed prompts. However, these attacks suffer from the model's tendency to hallucinate and catastrophic forgetting (CF) in the pre-training stage, rendering the veracity of divulged PIIs negligible. In our research, we propose a novel attack, Janus, which exploits the fine-tuning interface to recover forgotten PIIs from the pre-training data in LLMs. We formalize the privacy leakage problem in LLMs and explain why forgotten PIIs can be recovered through empirical analysis on open-source language models. Based upon these insights, we evaluate the performance of Janus on both open-source language models and two latest LLMs, i.e., GPT-3.5-Turbo and LLaMA-2-7b. Our experiment results show that Janus amplifies the privacy risks by over 10 times in comparison with the baseline and significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art privacy extraction attacks including prefix attacks and in-context learning (ICL).

To address these issues, a novel approach named GraphSmile is proposed for tracking intricate emotional cues in multimodal dialogues. GraphSmile comprises two key components, i.e., GSF and SDP modules. GSF ingeniously leverages graph structures to alternately assimilate inter-modal and intra-modal emotional dependencies layer by layer, adequately capturing cross-modal cues while effectively circumventing fusion conflicts. SDP is an auxiliary task to explicitly delineate the sentiment dynamics between utterances, promoting the model's ability to distinguish sentimental discrepancies. Furthermore, GraphSmile is effortlessly applied to multimodal sentiment analysis in conversation (MSAC), forging a unified multimodal affective model capable of executing MERC and MSAC tasks. Empirical results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate that GraphSmile can handle complex emotional and sentimental patterns, significantly outperforming baseline models.",

In addition, due to the limitations of small-scale datasets containing scripted recording styles, they often fail to simulate real natural conversational styles. To address the above issues, we propose a novel generative expressive CSS system, termed GPT-Talker.We transform the multimodal information of the multi-turn dialogue history into discrete token sequences and seamlessly integrate them to form a comprehensive user-agent dialogue context. Leveraging the power of GPT, we predict the token sequence, that includes both semantic and style knowledge, of response for the agent. After that, the expressive conversational speech is synthesized by the conversation-enriched VITS to deliver feedback to the user.Furthermore, we propose a large-scale Natural CSS Dataset called NCSSD, that includes both naturally recorded conversational speech in improvised styles and dialogues extracted from TV shows. It encompasses both Chinese and English languages, with a total duration of 236 hours.We conducted comprehensive experiments on the reliability of the NCSSD and the effectiveness of our GPT-Talker. Both subjective and objective evaluations demonstrate that our model outperforms other state-of-the-art CSS systems significantly in terms of naturalness and expressiveness.

        "abstract": "Large autoregressive generative models have emerged as the cornerstone for achieving the highest performance across several Natural Language Processing tasks. However, the urge to attain superior results has, at times, led to the premature replacement of carefully designed task-specific approaches without exhaustive experimentation. The Coreference Resolution task is no exception; all recent state-of-the-art solutions adopt large generative autoregressive models that outperform encoder-based discriminative systems. In this work,we challenge this recent trend by introducing Maverick, a carefully designed - yet simple - pipeline, which enables running a state-of-the-art Coreference Resolution system within the constraints of an academic budget, outperforming models with up to 13 billion parameters with as few as 500 million parameters. Maverick achieves state-of-the-art performance on the CoNLL-2012 benchmark, training with up to 0.006x the memory resources and obtaining a 170x faster inference compared to previous state-of-the-art systems. We extensively validate the robustness of the Maverick framework with an array of diverse experiments, reporting improvements over prior systems in data-scarce, long-document, and out-of-domain settings.

        "abstract": "Despite large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in various tasks, they are still suffering from the factual inconsistency problem called hallucinations. For instance, LLMs occasionally generate content that diverges from source article, and prefer to extract information that appears at the beginning and end of the context, especially in long document summarization. Inspired by these findings, we propose to improve the faithfulness of LLMs in summarization by impelling them to process the entire article more fairly and faithfully. We present a novel summary generation strategy, namely SliSum, which exploits the ideas of sliding windows and self-consistency. Specifically, SliSum divides the source article into overlapping windows, and utilizes LLM to generate local summaries for the content in the windows. Finally, SliSum aggregates all local summaries using clustering and majority voting algorithm to produce more faithful summary of entire article. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SliSum significantly improves the faithfulness of diverse LLMs including LLaMA-2, Claude-2 and GPT-3.5 in both short and long text summarization, while maintaining their fluency and informativeness and without additional fine-tuning and resources. We further conduct qualitative and quantitative studies to investigate why SliSum works and impacts of hyperparameters in SliSum on performance.",

We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making.

        "abstract": "Modern language models (LMs) need to follow human instructions while being faithful; yet, they often fail to achieve both. Here, we provide concrete evidence of a trade-off between instruction following (i.e., follow open-ended instructions) and faithfulness (i.e., ground responses in given context) when training LMs with these objectives. For instance, fine-tuning LLaMA-7B on instruction following datasets renders it less faithful. Conversely, instruction-tuned Vicuna-7B shows degraded performance at following instructions when further optimized on tasks that require contextual grounding. One common remedy is multi-task learning (MTL) with data mixing, yet it remains far from achieving a synergic outcome. We propose a simple yet effective method that relies on Rejection Sampling for Continued Self-instruction Tuning (ReSet), which significantly outperforms vanilla MTL. Surprisingly, we find that less is more, as training ReSet with high-quality, yet substantially smaller data (three-fold less) yields superior results.

Compared to sentence-level relation extraction, it requires more complex semantic understanding from a broader text context. Currently, some studies are utilizing logical rules within evidence sentences to enhance the performance of DocRE. However, in the data without provided evidence sentences, researchers often obtain a list of evidence sentences for the entire document through evidence retrieval (ER). Therefore, DocRE suffers from two challenges: firstly, the relevance between evidence and entity pairs is weak; secondly, there is insufficient extraction of complex cross-relations between long-distance multi-entities. To overcome these challenges, we propose GEGA, a novel model for DocRE. The model leverages graph neural networks to construct multiple weight matrices, guiding attention allocation to evidence sentences. It also employs multi-scale representation aggregation to enhance ER. Subsequently, we integrate the most efficient evidence information to implement both fully supervised and weakly supervised training processes for the model.

        "abstract": "Model attribution for machine-generated disinformation poses a significant challenge in understanding its origins and mitigating its spread. This task is especially challenging because modern large language models (LLMs) produce disinformation with human-like quality. Additionally, the diversity in prompting methods used to generate disinformation complicates accurate source attribution. These methods introduce domain-specific features that can mask the fundamental characteristics of the models. In this paper, we introduce the concept of model attribution as a domain generalization problem, where each prompting method represents a unique domain. We argue that an effective attribution model must be invariant to these domain-specific features. It should also be proficient in identifying the originating models across all scenarios, reflecting real-world detection challenges. To address this, we introduce a novel approach based on Supervised Contrastive Learning. This method is designed to enhance the model's robustness to variations in prompts and focuses on distinguishing between different source LLMs. We evaluate our model through rigorous experiments involving three common prompting methods: ``open-ended'', ``rewriting'', and ``paraphrasing'', and three advanced LLMs: ``llama 2'', ``chatgpt'', and ``vicuna''.

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) are extensively used, there are raising concerns regarding privacy, security, and copyright due to their opaque training data, which brings the problem of detecting pre-training data on the table. Current solutions to this problem leverage techniques explored in machine learning privacy such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which heavily depend on LLMs' capability of verbatim memorization. However, this reliance presents challenges, especially given the vast amount of training data and the restricted number of effective training epochs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive pre-training data detection method which alleviates this reliance and effectively amplify the identification. Our method adaptively locates \\textit{surprising tokens} of the input. A token is surprising to a LLM if the prediction on the token is \"certain but wrong\", which refers to low Shannon entropy of the probability distribution and low probability of the ground truth token at the same time. By using the prediction probability of surprising tokens to measure \\textit{surprising}, the detection method is achieved based on the simple hypothesis that seeing seen data is less surprising for the model compared with seeing unseen data. The method can be applied without any access to the the pre-training data corpus or additional training like reference models. Our approach exhibits a consistent enhancement compared to existing methods in diverse experiments conducted on various benchmarks and models, achieving a maximum improvement of 29.5\\%.

These heads are trained in a self-supervised manner using the model's own predictions as training data, thereby eliminating the need for additional annotated data. The confidence metric, established using a calibration set, ensures a desired level of accuracy while enabling early termination when confidence exceeds a predetermined threshold.

Despite promising results in downstream tasks such as speech recognition, speaker verification, and emotion recognition, a significant number of parameters is required, which makes fine-tuning for each task memory-inefficient. To address this limitation, we introduce ELP-adapter tuning, a novel method for parameter-efficient fine-tuning using three types of adapter, namely encoder adapters (E-adapters), layer adapters (L-adapters), and a prompt adapter (P-adapter). The E-adapters are integrated into transformer-based encoder layers and help to learn fine-grained speech representations that are effective for speech recognition. The L-adapters create paths from each encoder layer to the downstream head and help to extract non-linguistic features from lower encoder layers that are effective for speaker verification and emotion recognition. The P-adapter appends pseudo features to CNN features to further improve effectiveness and efficiency. With these adapters, models can be quickly adapted to various speech processing tasks. Our evaluation across four downstream tasks using five backbone models demonstrated the effectiveness of the proposed method.

The recent rapid uptake of building information models (BIM) in the construction industry has created more opportunities for automated compliance checking (ACC). BIM enables sharing of digital building design data that can be used for compliance checking with legal requirements, which are conventionally conveyed in natural language and not intended for machine processing. Creating a computable representation of legal requirements suitable for ACC is complex, costly, and time-consuming. Large language models (LLMs) such as the generative pre-trained transformers (GPT), GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, powering OpenAI's ChatGPT, can generate logically coherent text and source code responding to user prompts. This capability could be used to automate the conversion of building regulations into a semantic and computable representation. This paper evaluates the performance of LLMs in translating building regulations into LegalRuleML in a few-shot learning setup. By providing GPT-3.5 with only a few example translations, it can learn the basic structure of the format. Using a system prompt, we further specify the LegalRuleML representation and explore the existence of expert domain knowledge in the model. Such domain knowledge might be ingrained in GPT-3.5 through the broad pre-training but needs to be brought forth by careful contextualisation. Finally, we investigate whether strategies such as chain-of-thought reasoning and self-consistency could apply to this use case. As LLMs become more sophisticated, the increased common sense, logical coherence, and means to domain adaptation can significantly support ACC, leading to more efficient and effective checking processes.",

The increasing demands of application scenarios have driven the evolution of RAG, leading to the integration of advanced retrievers, LLMs and other complementary technologies, which in turn has amplified the intricacy of RAG systems. However, the rapid advancements are outpacing the foundational RAG paradigm, with many methods struggling to be unified under the process of \"retrieve-then-generate\". In this context, this paper examines the limitations of the existing RAG paradigm and introduces the modular RAG framework. By decomposing complex RAG systems into independent modules and specialized operators, it facilitates a highly reconfigurable framework. Modular RAG transcends the traditional linear architecture, embracing a more advanced design that integrates routing, scheduling, and fusion mechanisms. Drawing on extensive research, this paper further identifies prevalent RAG patterns-linear, conditional, branching, and looping-and offers a comprehensive analysis of their respective implementation nuances. Modular RAG presents innovative opportunities for the conceptualization and deployment of RAG systems. Finally, the paper explores the potential emergence of new operators and paradigms, establishing a solid theoretical foundation and a practical roadmap for the continued evolution and practical deployment of RAG technologies.",

        "abstract": "In the current landscape of language model research, larger models, larger datasets and more compute seems to be the only way to advance towards intelligence. While there have been extensive studies of scaling laws and models' scaling behaviors, the effect of scale on a model's social biases and stereotyping tendencies has received less attention. In this study, we explore the influence of model scale and pre-training data on its learnt social biases. We focus on BERT -- an extremely popular language model -- and investigate biases as they show up during language modeling (upstream), as well as during classification applications after fine-tuning (downstream). Our experiments on four architecture sizes of BERT demonstrate that pre-training data substantially influences how upstream biases evolve with model scale. With increasing scale, models pre-trained on large internet scrapes like Common Crawl exhibit higher toxicity, whereas models pre-trained on moderated data sources like Wikipedia show greater gender stereotypes. However, downstream biases generally decrease with increasing model scale, irrespective of the pre-training data. Our results highlight the qualitative role of pre-training data in the biased behavior of language models, an often overlooked aspect in the study of scale. Through a detailed case study of BERT, we shed light on the complex interplay of data and model scale, and investigate how it translates to concrete biases.",

        "abstract": "While large language models are rapidly moving towards consumer-facing applications, they are often still prone to factual errors and hallucinations. In order to reduce the potential harms that may come from these errors, it is important for users to know to what extent they can trust an LLM when it makes a factual claim. To this end, we study the problem of uncertainty quantification of factual correctness in long-form natural language generation. Given some output from a large language model, we study both uncertainty at the level of individual claims contained within the output (via calibration) and uncertainty across the entire output itself (via conformal prediction). Moreover, we invoke multicalibration and multivalid conformal prediction to ensure that such uncertainty guarantees are valid both marginally and across distinct groups of prompts. Using the task of biography generation, we demonstrate empirically that having access to and making use of additional group attributes for each prompt improves both overall and group-wise performance. As the problems of calibration, conformal prediction, and their multi-group counterparts have not been extensively explored previously in the context of long-form text generation, we consider these empirical results to form a benchmark for this setting.",

        "abstract": "Customers' reviews and feedback play crucial role on electronic commerce~(E-commerce) platforms like Amazon, Zalando, and eBay in influencing other customers' purchasing decisions. However, there is a prevailing concern that sellers often post fake or spam reviews to deceive potential customers and manipulate their opinions about a product. Over the past decade, there has been considerable interest in using machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to identify such fraudulent reviews. Unfortunately, the decisions made by complex ML and DL models - which often function as \\emph{black-boxes} - can be surprising and difficult for general users to comprehend. In this paper, we propose an explainable framework for detecting fake reviews with high precision in identifying fraudulent content with explanations and investigate what information matters most for explaining particular decisions by conducting empirical user evaluation. Initially, we develop fake review detection models using DL and transformer models including XLNet and DistilBERT. We then introduce layer-wise relevance propagation (LRP) technique for generating explanations that can map the contributions of words toward the predicted class. The experimental results on two benchmark fake review detection datasets demonstrate that our predictive models achieve state-of-the-art performance and outperform several existing methods. Furthermore, the empirical user evaluation of the generated explanations concludes which important information needs to be considered in generating explanations in the context of fake review identification.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited remarkable proficiency in natural language understanding, prompting extensive exploration of their potential applications across diverse domains. In the medical domain, open-source LLMs have demonstrated moderate efficacy following domain-specific fine-tuning; however, they remain substantially inferior to proprietary models such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5. These open-source models encounter limitations in the comprehensiveness of domain-specific knowledge and exhibit a propensity for 'hallucinations' during text generation. To mitigate these issues, researchers have implemented the Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach, which augments LLMs with background information from external knowledge bases while preserving the model's internal parameters. However, document noise can adversely affect performance, and the application of RAG in the medical field remains in its nascent stages. This study presents the Bailicai framework: a novel integration of retrieval-augmented generation with large language models optimized for the medical domain. The Bailicai framework augments the performance of LLMs in medicine through the implementation of four sub-modules. Experimental results demonstrate that the Bailicai approach surpasses existing medical domain LLMs across multiple medical benchmarks and exceeds the performance of GPT-3.5. Furthermore, the Bailicai method effectively attenuates the prevalent issue of hallucinations in medical applications of LLMs and ameliorates the noise-related challenges associated with traditional RAG techniques when processing irrelevant or pseudo-relevant documents.",

This work proposes an improved automated knowledge modeling algorithm to create knowledge models from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) CPGs in Oncology for different cancer types. The proposed algorithm has been evaluated with NCCN CPGs for four different cancer types. We also proposed an algorithm to compare the knowledge models for different versions of a guideline to discover the specific changes introduced in the treatment protocol of a new version. We created a question-answering (Q&A) framework with the guideline knowledge models as the augmented knowledge base to study our ability to query the knowledge models. We compiled a set of 32 question-answer pairs derived from two reliable data sources for the treatment of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) to evaluate the Q&A framework. The framework was evaluated against the question-answer pairs from one data source, and it can generate the answers with 54.5% accuracy from the treatment algorithm and 81.8% accuracy from the discussion part of the NCCN NSCLC guideline knowledge model.",

        "abstract": "Cross-domain Aspect Sentiment Triplet Extraction (ASTE) aims to extract fine-grained sentiment elements from target domain sentences by leveraging the knowledge acquired from the source domain. Due to the absence of labeled data in the target domain, recent studies tend to rely on pre-trained language models to generate large amounts of synthetic data for training purposes. However, these approaches entail additional computational costs associated with the generation process. Different from them, we discover a striking resemblance between table-filling methods in ASTE and two-stage Object Detection (OD) in computer vision, which inspires us to revisit the cross-domain ASTE task and approach it from an OD standpoint. This allows the model to benefit from the OD extraction paradigm and region-level alignment. Building upon this premise, we propose a novel method named \\textbf{T}able-\\textbf{F}illing via \\textbf{M}ean \\textbf{T}eacher (TFMT). Specifically, the table-filling methods encode the sentence into a 2D table to detect word relations, while TFMT treats the table as a feature map and utilizes a region consistency to enhance the quality of those generated pseudo labels. Additionally, considering the existence of the domain gap, a cross-domain consistency based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy is designed to alleviate domain shift problems. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance with minimal parameters and computational costs, making it a strong baseline for cross-domain ASTE.",

        "abstract": "Continuing advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) in artificial intelligence offer important capacities in intuitively accessing and using medical knowledge in many contexts, including education and training as well as assessment and treatment. Most of the initial literature on LLMs in medicine has emphasized that LLMs are unsuitable for medical use because they are non-deterministic, may provide incorrect or harmful responses, and cannot be regulated to assure quality control. If these issues could be corrected, optimizing LLM technology could benefit patients and physicians by providing affordable, point-of-care medical knowledge. Our proposed framework refines LLM responses by restricting their primary knowledge base to domain-specific datasets containing validated medical information. Additionally, we introduce an actor-critic LLM prompting protocol based on active inference principles of human cognition, where a Therapist agent initially responds to patient queries, and a Supervisor agent evaluates and adjusts responses to ensure accuracy and reliability. We conducted a validation study where expert cognitive behaviour therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) therapists evaluated responses from the LLM in a blind format. Experienced human CBT-I therapists assessed responses to 100 patient queries, comparing LLM-generated responses with appropriate and inappropriate responses crafted by experienced CBT-I therapists. Results showed that LLM responses received high ratings from the CBT-I therapists, often exceeding those of therapist-generated appropriate responses. This structured approach aims to integrate advanced LLM technology into medical applications, meeting regulatory requirements for establishing the safe and effective use of special purpose validated LLMs in medicine.",

The study underscores AI and NLP's transformative impact on healthcare delivery and management. Integrating AI and NLP technologies enhances documentation and simplifies administrative tasks by precisely extracting complex clinical information. This approach effectively addresses challenges in dental diagnostics.

The tasks progressively increase in difficulty and allow more nuanced evaluation of model capabilities than tests like the popular needle-in-the-haystack test. We find that performance degrades significantly (up to 2x) when a function references another function that is defined later in the prompt. We also observe that models that use sliding window attention mechanisms have difficulty handling references further than the size of a single window. We perform simple prompt modifications using call graph information to improve multi-step retrieval performance up to 3x.

        "abstract": "Empathetic response generation is designed to comprehend the emotions of others and select the most appropriate strategies to assist them in resolving emotional challenges. Empathy can be categorized into cognitive empathy and affective empathy. The former pertains to the ability to understand and discern the emotional issues and situations of others, while the latter involves the capacity to provide comfort. To enhance one's empathetic abilities, it is essential to develop both these aspects. Therefore, we develop an innovative framework that combines retrieval augmentation and emotional support strategy integration. Our framework starts with the introduction of a comprehensive emotional palette for empathy. We then apply appraisal theory to decompose this palette and create a database of empathetic responses. This database serves as an external resource and enhances the LLM's empathy by integrating semantic retrieval mechanisms. Moreover, our framework places a strong emphasis on the proper articulation of response strategies. By incorporating emotional support strategies, we aim to enrich the model's capabilities in both cognitive and affective empathy, leading to a more nuanced and comprehensive empathetic response. Finally, we extract datasets ED and ET from the empathetic dialogue dataset \\textsc{EmpatheticDialogues} and ExTES based on dialogue length.

        "abstract": "Autoregressive language models are the currently dominant paradigm for text generation, but they have some fundamental limitations that cannot be remedied by scale-for example inherently sequential and unidirectional generation. While alternate classes of models have been explored, we have limited mathematical understanding of their fundamental power and limitations. In this paper we focus on Generative Masked Language Models (GMLMs), a non-autoregressive paradigm in which we train a model to fit conditional probabilities of the data distribution via masking, which are subsequently used as inputs to a Markov Chain to draw samples from the model, These models empirically strike a promising speed-quality trade-off as each step can be typically parallelized by decoding the entire sequence in parallel. We develop a mathematical framework for analyzing and improving such models which sheds light on questions of sample complexity and inference speed and quality. Empirically, we adapt the T5 model for iteratively-refined parallel decoding, achieving 2-3x speedup in machine translation with minimal sacrifice in quality compared with autoregressive models. We run careful ablation experiments to give recommendations on key design choices, and make fine-grained observations on the common error modes in connection with our theory. Our mathematical analyses and empirical observations characterize both potentials and limitations of this approach, and can be applied to future works on improving understanding and performance of GMLMs. Our codes are released at this https URL",

Herein, we prepared 983 tasks related to water engineering and research, categorized into \"wastewater treatment\", \"environmental restoration\", \"drinking water treatment and distribution\", \"sanitation\", \"anaerobic digestion\" and \"contaminants assessment\".

More specifically, current LLMs excelled particularly in generating precise research gaps for papers on \"contaminants and related water quality monitoring and assessment\". Additionally, they were more adept at creating appropriate titles for research papers on \"treatment processes for wastewaters\", \"environmental restoration\", and \"drinking water treatment\".

        "abstract": "Real-world navigation often involves dealing with unexpected obstructions such as closed doors, moved objects, and unpredictable entities. However, mainstream Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks typically assume instructions perfectly align with the fixed and predefined navigation graphs without any obstructions. This assumption overlooks potential discrepancies in actual navigation graphs and given instructions, which can cause major failures for both indoor and outdoor agents. To address this issue, we integrate diverse obstructions into the R2R dataset by modifying both the navigation graphs and visual observations, introducing an innovative dataset and task, R2R with UNexpected Obstructions (R2R-UNO). R2R-UNO contains various types and numbers of path obstructions to generate instruction-reality mismatches for VLN research. Experiments on R2R-UNO reveal that state-of-the-art VLN methods inevitably encounter significant challenges when facing such mismatches, indicating that they rigidly follow instructions rather than navigate adaptively. Therefore, we propose a novel method called ObVLN (Obstructed VLN), which includes a curriculum training strategy and virtual graph construction to help agents effectively adapt to obstructed environments. Empirical results show that ObVLN not only maintains robust performance in unobstructed scenarios but also achieves a substantial performance advantage with unexpected obstructions.",

        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in processing and generating content across multiple data modalities, including text, images, audio, and video. However, a significant drawback of MLLMs is their reliance on static training data, leading to outdated information and limited contextual awareness. This static nature hampers their ability to provide accurate, up-to-date responses, particularly in dynamic or rapidly evolving contexts. Integrating Multimodal Retrieval-augmented Generation (Multimodal RAG) offers a promising solution, but the system would inevitably encounter the multi-granularity noisy correspondence (MNC) problem, which involves two types of noise: coarse-grained (query-caption) and fine-grained (query-image). This noise hinders accurate retrieval and generation. In this work, we propose \\textbf{RagLLaVA}, a novel framework with knowledge-enhanced reranking and noise-injected training, to address these limitations. We instruction-tune the MLLM with a simple yet effective instruction template to induce its ranking ability and serve it as a reranker to precisely filter the top-k retrieved images. For generation, we inject visual noise during training at the data and token levels to enhance the generator's robustness. Extensive experiments are conducted on the subsets of two datasets that require retrieving and reasoning over images to answer a given query.

Despite the prevalence of approaches in English, there is a notable lack of systems specifically developed for certain languages, particularly Vietnamese. This study aims to bridge this gap by conducting comprehensive experiments on the Vietnamese Visual Question Answering (ViVQA) dataset, demonstrating the effectiveness of our proposed model. In response to community interest, we have developed a model that enhances image representation capabilities, thereby improving overall performance in the ViVQA system. Specifically, our model integrates the Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training with frozen unimodal models (BLIP-2) and the convolutional neural network EfficientNet to extract and process both local and global features from images. This integration leverages the strengths of transformer-based architectures for capturing comprehensive contextual information and convolutional networks for detailed local features. By freezing the parameters of these pre-trained models, we significantly reduce the computational cost and training time, while maintaining high performance. This approach significantly improves image representation and enhances the performance of existing VQA systems. We then leverage a multi-modal fusion module based on a general-purpose multi-modal foundation model (BEiT-3) to fuse the information between visual and textual features.

Significant progress has been made in this domain by leveraging classification based learning methods. Inspired by the recent paradigm of 'pretrain, prompt and predict' in NLP, we consider sequential recommendation as a sequence to sequence generation task and propose a novel model named Generative Recommendation (GenRec). Unlike classification based models that learn explicit user and item representations, GenRec utilizes the sequence modeling capability of Transformer and adopts the masked item prediction objective to effectively learn the hidden bidirectional sequential patterns. Different from existing generative sequential recommendation models, GenRec does not rely on manually designed hard prompts. The input to GenRec is textual user item sequence and the output is top ranked next items. Moreover, GenRec is lightweight and requires only a few hours to train effectively in low-resource settings, making it highly applicable to real-world scenarios and helping to democratize large language models in the sequential recommendation domain. Our extensive experiments have demonstrated that GenRec generalizes on various public real-world datasets and achieves state-of-the-art results.

The results demonstrate that PGD-BERT-Attack achieves higher success rates in causing misclassification while maintaining low perceptual changes. Furthermore, PGD-BERT-Attack produces adversarial instances that exhibit greater semantic resemblance to the initial input, enhancing their applicability in real-world scenarios.

Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension (MRC-based) frameworks or sequence generation-based models face challenges in understanding the relationships of multimodal entities. MRC-based frameworks, utilizing human-designed queries, struggle to model intra-entity connections. Meanwhile, sequence generation-based outputs excessively rely on inter-entity dependencies due to pre-defined decoding order. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN consists of a Multi-grained Query Set (MQS) and a Multimodal Set Prediction Network (MSP). MQS combines specific type-grained and learnable entity-grained queries to adaptively strengthen intra-entity connections by explicitly aligning visual regions with textual spans. Based on solid intra-entity modeling, MSP reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, enabling the parallel prediction of multimodal entities in a non-autoregressive manner, eliminating redundant dependencies from preceding sequences, and guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a global matching perspective. Additionally, to boost better alignment of two-level relationships, we also incorporate a Query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) to work as a glue network between MQS and MSP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks.

Recently, the linear-complexity operator of the state space models (SSMs) has contrarily facilitated efficient long-term temporal modeling, which is crucial for rain streaks and raindrops removal in videos.

        "abstract": "Existing Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) primarily align image features of vision encoder with Large Language Models (LLMs) to leverage their superior text generation capabilities. However, the scale disparity between vision encoder and language model may led to LLMs assuming a predominant role in multi-modal comprehension. This imbalance in LVLMs may result in the instances of hallucinatory. Concretely, LVLMs may generate consistent descriptions with or without visual input, indicating that certain outputs are influenced solely by context text. We refer to this phenomenon as \"text inertia.\" To counteract this issue, we introduce a training-free algorithm to find an equilibrium point between image comprehension and language inference. Specifically, we adaptively involve adjusting and amplifying the attention weights assigned to image tokens, thereby granting greater prominence to visual elements. Meanwhile, we subtract the logits of multi-modal inputs from ones of pure text input, which can help LVLMs be not biased towards LLMs. By enhancing images tokens and reducing the stubborn output of LLM, we can let LVLM pay more attention to images, towards alleviating text inertia and reducing the hallucination in LVLMs. Our extensive experiments shows that this method substantially reduces the frequency of hallucinatory outputs in various LVLMs in terms of different metrics.

        "abstract": "Adapting foundation models for medical image analysis requires finetuning them on a considerable amount of data because of extreme distribution shifts between natural (source) data used for pretraining and medical (target) data. However, collecting task-specific medical data for such finetuning at a central location raises many privacy concerns. Although Federated learning (FL) provides an effective means for training on private decentralized data, communication costs in federating large foundation models can quickly become a significant bottleneck, impacting the solution's scalability. In this work, we address this problem of efficient communication while ensuring effective learning in FL by combining the strengths of Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) with FL. Specifically, we study plug-and-play Low-Rank Adapters (LoRA) in a federated manner to adapt the Segment Anything Model (SAM) for 3D medical image segmentation. Unlike prior works that utilize LoRA and finetune the entire decoder, we critically analyze the contribution of each granular component of SAM on finetuning performance. Thus, we identify specific layers to be federated that are very efficient in terms of communication cost while producing on-par accuracy. Our experiments show that retaining the parameters of the SAM model (including most of the decoder) in their original state during adaptation is beneficial because fine-tuning on small datasets tends to distort the inherent capabilities of the underlying foundation model. On Fed-KiTS, our approach decreases communication cost (~48x) compared to full fine-tuning while increasing performance (~6% Dice score) in 3D segmentation tasks. Our approach performs similar to SAMed while achieving ~2.8x reduction in communication and parameters to be finetuned.

Unlike traditional approaches that use specialized architectures for each specific task, we propose a unified framework, EventMatch, that reformulates these tasks as an event-based dense correspondence matching problem, allowing them to be solved with a single model by directly comparing feature similarities. By utilizing a shared feature similarities module, which integrates knowledge from other event flows via temporal or spatial interactions, and distinct task heads, our network can concurrently perform optical flow estimation from temporal inputs (e.g., two segments of event streams in the temporal domain) and stereo matching from spatial inputs (e.g., two segments of event streams from different viewpoints in the spatial domain). Moreover, we further demonstrate that our unified model inherently supports cross-task transfer since the architecture and parameters are shared across tasks. Without the need for retraining on each task, our model can effectively handle both optical flow and disparity estimation simultaneously. The experiment conducted on the DSEC benchmark demonstrates that our model exhibits superior performance in both optical flow and disparity estimation tasks, outperforming existing state-of-the-art methods. Our unified approach not only advances event-based models but also opens new possibilities for cross-task transfer and inter-task fusion in both spatial and temporal dimensions.

        "abstract": "Rapid identification and accurate documentation of interfering and high-risk behaviors in ASD, such as aggression, self-injury, disruption, and restricted repetitive behaviors, are important in daily classroom environments for tracking intervention effectiveness and allocating appropriate resources to manage care needs. However, having a staff dedicated solely to observing is costly and uncommon in most educational settings. Recently, multiple research studies have explored developing automated, continuous, and objective tools using machine learning models to quantify behaviors in ASD. However, the majority of the work was conducted under a controlled environment and has not been validated for real-world conditions. In this work, we demonstrate that the latest advances in video-based group activity recognition techniques can quantify behaviors in ASD in real-world activities in classroom environments while preserving privacy. Our explainable model could detect the episode of problem behaviors with a 77% F1-score and capture distinctive behavior features in different types of behaviors in ASD. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that shows the promise of objectively quantifying behaviors in ASD in a real-world environment, which is an important step toward the development of a practical tool that can ease the burden of data collection for classroom staff.",

        "abstract": "Incremental object detection (IOD) aims to sequentially learn new classes, while maintaining the capability to locate and identify old ones. As the training data arrives with annotations only with new classes, IOD suffers from catastrophic forgetting. Prior methodologies mainly tackle the forgetting issue through knowledge distillation and exemplar replay, ignoring the conflict between limited model capacity and increasing knowledge. In this paper, we explore \\textit{dynamic object queries} for incremental object detection built on Transformer architecture.

First, a new set of learnable object queries are fed into the decoder to represent new classes. These new object queries are aggregated with those from previous phases to adapt both old and new knowledge well. Second, we propose the isolated bipartite matching for object queries in different phases, based on disentangled self-attention. The interaction among the object queries at different phases is eliminated to reduce inter-class confusion. Thanks to the separate supervision and computation over object queries, we further present the risk-balanced partial calibration for effective exemplar replay. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DyQ-DETR significantly surpasses the state-of-the-art methods, with limited parameter overhead. Code will be made publicly available.",

We design ExAvatar as a combination of the whole-body parametric mesh model (SMPL-X) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). The main challenges are 1) a limited diversity of facial expressions and poses in the video and 2) the absence of 3D observations, such as 3D scans and RGBD images. The limited diversity in the video makes animations with novel facial expressions and poses non-trivial. In addition, the absence of 3D observations could cause significant ambiguity in human parts that are not observed in the video, which can result in noticeable artifacts under novel motions. To address them, we introduce our hybrid representation of the mesh and 3D Gaussians. Our hybrid representation treats each 3D Gaussian as a vertex on the surface with pre-defined connectivity information (i.e., triangle faces) between them following the mesh topology of SMPL-X. It makes our ExAvatar animatable with novel facial expressions by driven by the facial expression space of SMPL-X. In addition, by using connectivity-based regularizers, we significantly reduce artifacts in novel facial expressions and poses.",

However, its inherent statistical characteristics can significantly impact downstream tasks, potentially compromising deployment performance. In this study, we empirically investigate this issue and uncover a critical phenomenon: downstream neural networks often exploit spurious distinctions between real and synthetic data when there is a strong correlation between the data source and the task label. This exploitation manifests as \\textit{simplicity bias}, where models overly rely on superficial features rather than genuine task-related complexities. Through principled experiments, we demonstrate that the source of data (real vs.\\ synthetic) can introduce spurious correlating factors leading to poor performance during deployment when the correlation is absent. We first demonstrate this vulnerability on a digit classification task, where the model spuriously utilizes the source of data instead of the digit to provide an inference. We provide further evidence of this phenomenon in a medical imaging problem related to cardiac view classification in echocardiograms, particularly distinguishing between 2-chamber and 4-chamber views.

The subtle phenotypical and physiological changes in response to drought stress are captured by non-invasive imaging techniques and these imaging data serve as valuable resource for machine learning methods to identify drought stress. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are in wide use, vision transformers (ViTs) present a promising alternative in capturing long-range dependencies and intricate spatial relationships, thereby enhancing the detection of subtle indicators of drought stress. We propose an explainable deep learning pipeline that leverages the power of ViTs for drought stress detection in potato crops using aerial imagery. We applied two distinct approaches: a synergistic combination of ViT and support vector machine (SVM), where ViT extracts intricate spatial features from aerial images, and SVM classifies the crops as stressed or healthy and an end-to-end approach using a dedicated classification layer within ViT to directly detect drought stress. Our key findings explain the ViT model's decision-making process by visualizing attention maps. These maps highlight the specific spatial features within the aerial images that the ViT model focuses as the drought stress signature. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed methods not only achieve high accuracy in drought stress identification but also shedding light on the diverse subtle plant features associated with drought stress.

Among these networks, our recently proposed RoadFormer successfully extracts heterogeneous features from RGB images and surface normal maps and fuses these features through attention mechanisms, demonstrating compelling efficacy in RGB-Normal road scene parsing. However, its performance significantly deteriorates when handling other types/sources of data or performing more universal, all-category scene parsing tasks. To overcome these limitations, this study introduces RoadFormer+, an efficient, robust, and adaptable model capable of effectively fusing RGB-X data, where ``X'', represents additional types/modalities of data such as depth, thermal, surface normal, and polarization. Specifically, we propose a novel hybrid feature decoupling encoder to extract heterogeneous features and decouple them into global and local components. These decoupled features are then fused through a dual-branch multi-scale heterogeneous feature fusion block, which employs parallel Transformer attentions and convolutional neural network modules to merge multi-scale features across different scales and receptive fields. The fused features are subsequently fed into a decoder to generate the final semantic predictions.

Guided by CLIP, which is pre-trained on RGB images, existing approaches achieve zero-shot object recognition by maximizing embedding similarities between event data encoded by an event encoder and RGB images encoded by the CLIP image encoder. Alternatively, several methods learn RGB frame reconstructions from event data for the CLIP image encoder. However, these approaches often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.\nThis study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks. We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: global similarity-based objective (i.e., maximizing the embedding similarities) cause semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space due to the degree of freedom. To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise regularization strategy. Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also propose a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images.\nExperimentally, our data synthesis strategy exhibits an attractive scaling property, and our method achieves superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches.

        "abstract": "Current histopathology research has primarily focused on using whole-slide images (WSIs) produced by scanners with weakly-supervised multiple instance learning (MIL). However, WSIs are costly, memory-intensive, and require extensive analysis time. As an alternative, microscopy-based analysis offers cost and memory efficiency, though microscopy images face issues with unknown absolute positions and redundant images due to multiple captures from the subjective perspectives of pathologists. To this end, we introduce MicroMIL, a weakly-supervised MIL framework specifically built to address these challenges by dynamically clustering images using deep cluster embedding (DCE) and Gumbel Softmax for representative image extraction. Graph edges are then constructed from the upper triangular similarity matrix, with nodes connected to their most similar neighbors, and a graph neural network (GNN) is utilized to capture local and diverse areas of contextual information. Unlike existing graph-based MIL methods designed for WSIs that require absolute positions, MicroMIL efficiently handles the graph edges without this need. Extensive evaluations on real-world colon cancer (Seegene) and public BreakHis datasets demonstrate that MicroMIL outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, offering a robust and efficient solution for patient diagnosis using microscopy images.

        "abstract": "Mix-up is a key technique for consistency regularization-based semi-supervised learning methods, generating strong-perturbed samples for strong-weak pseudo-supervision. Existing mix-up operations are performed either randomly or with predefined rules, such as replacing low-confidence patches with high-confidence ones. The former lacks control over the perturbation degree, leading to overfitting on randomly perturbed samples, while the latter tends to generate images with trivial perturbations, both of which limit the effectiveness of consistency learning. This paper aims to answer the following question: How can image mix-up perturbation be adaptively performed during training? To this end, we propose an Adaptive Mix algorithm (AdaMix) for image mix-up in a self-paced learning manner. Given that, in general, a model's performance gradually improves during training, AdaMix is equipped with a self-paced curriculum that, in the initial training stage, provides relatively simple perturbed samples and then gradually increases the difficulty of perturbed images by adaptively controlling the perturbation degree based on the model's learning state estimated by a self-paced regularize. We develop three frameworks with our AdaMix, i.e., AdaMix-ST, AdaMix-MT, and AdaMix-CT, for semi-supervised medical image segmentation. Extensive experiments on three public datasets, including both 2D and 3D modalities, show that the proposed frameworks are capable of achieving superior performance. For example, compared with the state-of-the-art, AdaMix-CT achieves relative improvements of 2.62% in Dice and 48.25% in average surface distance on the ACDC dataset with 10% labeled data. The results demonstrate that mix-up operations with dynamically adjusted perturbation strength based on the segmentation model's state can significantly enhance the effectiveness of consistency regularization.",

        "abstract": "Perception systems of autonomous vehicles are susceptible to occlusion, especially when examined from a vehicle-centric perspective. Such occlusion can lead to overlooked object detections, e.g., larger vehicles such as trucks or buses may create blind spots where cyclists or pedestrians could be obscured, accentuating the safety concerns associated with such perception system limitations. To mitigate these challenges, the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) paradigm suggests employing an infrastructure-side perception system (IPS) to complement autonomous vehicles with a broader perceptual scope. Nevertheless, the scarcity of real-world 3D infrastructure-side datasets constrains the advancement of V2X technologies. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces a new 3D infrastructure-side collaborative perception dataset, abbreviated as inscope. Notably, InScope is the first dataset dedicated to addressing occlusion challenges by strategically deploying multiple-position Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems on the infrastructure side. Specifically, InScope encapsulates a 20-day capture duration with 303 tracking trajectories and 187,787 3D bounding boxes annotated by experts. Through analysis of benchmarks, four different benchmarks are presented for open traffic scenarios, including collaborative 3D object detection, multisource data fusion, data domain transfer, and 3D multiobject tracking tasks. Additionally, a new metric is designed to quantify the impact of occlusion, facilitating the evaluation of detection degradation ratios among various algorithms.

The influence of ``unqualified experts'' is minimised by weighting each contribution with a learnt in-distribution score. These weights promote transparency as the contribution of each expert is known during inference.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art.

Skeleton-based Human Activity Recognition has received much attention in recent years, where Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) based method is widely used and has achieved remarkable results. However, the representation of skeleton data and the issue of over-smoothing in GCN still need to be studied. 1). Compared to central nodes, edge nodes can only aggregate limited neighbor information, and different edge nodes of the human body are always structurally related. However, the information from edge nodes is crucial for fine-grained activity recognition. 2). The Graph Convolutional Network suffers from a significant over-smoothing issue, causing nodes to become increasingly similar as the number of network layers increases. Based on these two ideas, we propose a two-stream graph convolution method called Spatial-Structural GCN (SpSt-GCN). Spatial GCN performs information aggregation based on the topological structure of the human body, and structural GCN performs differentiation based on the similarity of edge node sequences. The spatial connection is fixed, and the human skeleton naturally maintains this topology regardless of the actions performed by humans. However, the structural connection is dynamic and depends on the type of movement the human body is performing. Based on this idea, we also propose an entirely data-driven structural connection, which greatly increases flexibility.

Network quantization is a promising way to reduce computational cost. However, a direct low-bit quantization will bring large performance drop.

        "abstract": "First-person hand-object interaction anticipation aims to predict the interaction process over a forthcoming period based on current scenes and prompts. This capability is crucial for embodied intelligence and human-robot collaboration. The complete interaction process involves both pre-contact interaction intention (i.e., hand motion trends and interaction hotspots) and post-contact interaction manipulation (i.e., manipulation trajectories and hand poses with contact). Existing research typically anticipates only interaction intention while neglecting manipulation, resulting in incomplete predictions and an increased likelihood of intention errors due to the lack of manipulation constraints. To address this, we propose a novel model, PEAR (Phrase-Based Hand-Object Interaction Anticipation), which jointly anticipates interaction intention and manipulation. To handle uncertainties in the interaction process, we employ a twofold approach. Firstly, we perform cross-alignment of verbs, nouns, and images to reduce the diversity of hand movement patterns and object functional attributes, thereby mitigating intention uncertainty. Secondly, we establish bidirectional constraints between intention and manipulation using dynamic integration and residual connections, ensuring consistency among elements and thus overcoming manipulation uncertainty. To rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we collect a new task-relevant dataset, EGO-HOIP, with comprehensive annotations. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our method.",

        "abstract": "Instance segmentation is an advanced form of image segmentation which, beyond traditional segmentation, requires identifying individual instances of repeating objects in a scene. Mask R-CNN is the most common architecture for instance segmentation, and improvements to this architecture include steps such as benefiting from bounding box refinements, adding semantics, or backbone enhancements. In all the proposed variations to date, the problem of competing kernels (each class aims to maximize its own accuracy) persists when models try to synchronously learn numerous classes. In this paper, we propose mitigating this problem by replacing mask prediction with a Switch-Split block that processes refined ROIs, classifies them, and assigns them to specialized mask predictors. We name the method MaskUno and test it on various models from the literature, which are then trained on multiple classes using the benchmark COCO dataset. An increase in the mean Average Precision (mAP) of 2.03% was observed for the high-performing DetectoRS when trained on 80 classes.

        "abstract": "Mitral regurgitation (MR) is a serious heart valve disease. Early and accurate diagnosis of MR via ultrasound video is critical for timely clinical decision-making and surgical intervention. However, manual MR diagnosis heavily relies on the operator's experience, which may cause misdiagnosis and inter-observer variability. Since MR data is limited and has large intra-class variability, we propose an unsupervised out-of-distribution (OOD) detection method to identify MR rather than building a deep classifier. To our knowledge, we are the first to explore OOD in MR ultrasound videos. Our method consists of a feature extractor, a feature reconstruction model, and a residual accumulation amplification algorithm. The feature extractor obtains features from the video clips and feeds them into the feature reconstruction model to restore the original features. The residual accumulation amplification algorithm then iteratively performs noise feature reconstruction, amplifying the reconstructed error of OOD features. This algorithm is straightforward yet efficient and can seamlessly integrate as a plug-and-play component in reconstruction-based OOD detection methods. We validated the proposed method on a large ultrasound dataset containing 893 non-MR and 267 MR videos. Experimental results show that our OOD detection method can effectively identify MR samples.",

However, this method is computationally demanding and necessitates large-scale video datasets.

Recent attempts to directly extract video snippets from image diffusion models have somewhat mitigated these problems.

In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-Shot video Sampling algorithm, denoted as $\\mathcal{ZS}^2$, capable of directly sampling high-quality video clips from existing image synthesis methods, such as Stable Diffusion, without any training or optimization. Specifically, $\\mathcal{ZS}^2$ utilizes the dependency noise model and temporal momentum attention to ensure content consistency and animation coherence, respectively. This ability enables it to excel in related tasks, such as conditional and context-specialized video generation and instruction-guided video editing.

        "abstract": "Childhood myopia constitutes a significant global health concern. It exhibits an escalating prevalence and has the potential to evolve into severe, irreversible conditions that detrimentally impact familial well-being and create substantial economic costs. Contemporary research underscores the importance of precisely predicting myopia progression to enable timely and effective interventions, thereby averting severe visual impairment in children. Such predictions predominantly rely on subjective clinical assessments, which are inherently biased and resource-intensive, thus hindering their widespread application. In this study, we introduce a novel, high-accuracy method for quantitatively predicting the myopic trajectory and myopia risk in children using only fundus images and baseline refraction data. This approach was validated through a six-year longitudinal study of 3,408 children in Henan, utilizing 16,211 fundus images and corresponding refractive data. Our method based on deep learning demonstrated predictive accuracy with an error margin of 0.311D per year and AUC scores of 0.944 and 0.995 for forecasting the risks of developing myopia and high myopia, respectively. These findings confirm the utility of our model in supporting early intervention strategies and in significantly reducing healthcare costs, particularly by obviating the need for additional metadata and repeated consultations. Furthermore, our method was designed to rely only on fundus images and refractive error data, without the need for meta data or multiple inquiries from doctors, strongly reducing the associated medical costs and facilitating large-scale screening. Our model can even provide good predictions based on only a single time measurement. Consequently, the proposed method is an important means to reduce medical inequities caused by economic disparities.",

        "abstract": "Learning from pseudo-labels that generated with VLMs~(Vision Language Models) has been shown as a promising solution to assist open vocabulary detection (OVD) in recent studies. However, due to the domain gap between VLM and vision-detection tasks, pseudo-labels produced by the VLMs are prone to be noisy, while the training design of the detector further amplifies the bias. In this work, we investigate the root cause of VLMs' biased prediction under the OVD context. Our observations lead to a simple yet effective paradigm, coded MarvelOVD, that generates significantly better training targets and optimizes the learning procedure in an online manner by marrying the capability of the detector with the vision-language model. Our key insight is that the detector itself can act as a strong auxiliary guidance to accommodate VLM's inability of understanding both the ``background'' and the context of a proposal within the image. Based on it, we greatly purify the noisy pseudo-labels via Online Mining and propose Adaptive Reweighting to effectively suppress the biased training boxes that are not well aligned with the target object. In addition, we also identify a neglected ``base-novel-conflict'' problem and introduce stratified label assignments to prevent it.

The dataset is intended to train models for comprehensive surface assessments of road networks. Existing open datasets are constrained by limited geospatial coverage and camera setups, typically excluding cycleways and footways. By crafting a heterogeneous dataset, we aim to fill this gap and enable robust models that maintain high accuracy across diverse image sources. However, the frequency distribution of road surface types and qualities is highly imbalanced. We address the challenge of ensuring sufficient images per class while reducing manual annotation by proposing a sampling strategy that incorporates various external label prediction resources. More precisely, we estimate the impact of (1) enriching the image data with OpenStreetMap tags, (2) iterative training and application of a custom surface type classification model, (3) amplifying underrepresented classes through prompt-based classification with GPT-4o or similarity search using image embeddings. We show that utilizing a combination of these strategies effectively reduces manual annotation workload while ensuring sufficient class representation.",

Recent methods propose to learn an entangled representation, aiming to model layered scene geometry, motion forecasting and novel view synthesis together, while assuming simplified affine motion and homography-based warping at each scene layer, leading to inaccurate video extrapolation. Instead of entangled scene representation and rendering, our approach chooses to disentangle scene geometry from scene motion, via lifting the 2D scene to 3D point clouds, which enables high quality rendering of future videos from novel views. To model future 3D scene motion, we propose a disentangled two-stage approach that initially forecasts ego-motion and subsequently the residual motion of dynamic objects (e.g., cars, people). This approach ensures more precise motion predictions by reducing inaccuracies from entanglement of ego-motion with dynamic object motion, where better ego-motion forecasting could significantly enhance the visual outcomes.

        "abstract": "In recent times, the need for effective super-resolution (SR) techniques has surged, especially for large-scale images ranging 2K to 8K resolutions. For DNN-based SISR, decomposing images into overlapping patches is typically necessary due to computational constraints. In such patch-decomposing scheme, one can allocate computational resources differently based on each patch's difficulty to further improve efficiency while maintaining SR performance. However, this approach has a limitation: computational resources is uniformly allocated within a patch, leading to lower efficiency when the patch contain pixels with varying levels of restoration difficulty. To address the issue, we propose the Pixel-level Classifier for Single Image Super-Resolution (PCSR), a novel method designed to distribute computational resources adaptively at the pixel level. A PCSR model comprises a backbone, a pixel-level classifier, and a set of pixel-level upsamplers with varying capacities. The pixel-level classifier assigns each pixel to an appropriate upsampler based on its restoration difficulty, thereby optimizing computational resource usage. Our method allows for performance and computational cost balance during inference without re-training.

It is an important step toward high-level visual reasoning and scene understanding. However, due to the natural bias from the real world, existing methods mostly struggle with rare human-object pairs and lead to sub-optimal results. Recently, with the development of the generative model, a straightforward approach is to construct a more balanced dataset based on a group of supplementary samples. Unfortunately, there is a significant domain gap between the generated data and the original data, and simply merging the generated images into the original dataset cannot significantly boost the performance.

Specifically, CEFA consists of a feature alignment module and a context enhancement module. On one hand, considering the crucial role of human-object pairs information in HOI tasks, the feature alignment module aligns the human-object pairs by aggregating instance information. On the other hand, to mitigate the issue of losing important context information caused by the traditional discriminator-style alignment method, we employ a context-enhanced image reconstruction module to improve the model's learning ability of contextual cues.

To tackle this, we propose a novel task: open-set tampered scene text detection, which evaluates forensics models on their ability to identify both seen and previously unseen forgery types. We have curated a comprehensive, high-quality dataset, featuring the texts tampered by eight text editing models, to thoroughly assess the open-set generalization capabilities. Further, we introduce a novel and effective pre-training paradigm that subtly alters the texture of selected texts within an image and trains the model to identify these regions.

Thus, there is a great demand for accurate video quality assessment (VQA) models to measure the perceptual quality of AI-generated content (AIGC) videos as well as optimize video generation techniques. However, assessing the quality of AIGC videos is quite challenging due to the highly complex distortions they exhibit (e.g., unnatural action, irrational objects, etc.). Therefore, in this paper, we try to systemically investigate the AIGC-VQA problem from both subjective and objective quality assessment perspectives. For the subjective perspective, we construct a Large-scale Generated Vdeo Quality assessment (LGVQ) dataset, consisting of 2,808 AIGC videos generated by 6 video generation models using 468 carefully selected text prompts. Unlike previous subjective VQA experiments, we evaluate the perceptual quality of AIGC videos from three dimensions: spatial quality, temporal quality, and text-to-video alignment, which hold utmost importance for current video generation techniques. For the objective perspective, we establish a benchmark for evaluating existing quality assessment metrics on the LGVQ dataset, which reveals that current metrics perform poorly on the LGVQ dataset. Thus, we propose a Unify Generated Video Quality assessment (UGVQ) model to comprehensively and accurately evaluate the quality of AIGC videos across three aspects using a unified model, which uses visual, textual and motion features of video and corresponding prompt, and integrates key features to enhance feature expression. We hope that our benchmark can promote the development of quality evaluation metrics for AIGC videos. The LGVQ dataset and the UGVQ metric will be publicly released.",

First, we investigate the characteristics of local spatial-temporal similarities of interference and design a novel unsupervised model to estimate the interference.

In the first stage, we estimate the initial rPPG signals by contrastive learning from both the training data and their augmented counterparts. In the second stage, we use the estimated interference features to derive de-interfered rPPG features and encourage the rPPG signals to be distinct from the interference. In addition, we propose an effective descriptive rPPG feature learning by developing a strong 3D Learnable Descriptive Convolution (3DLDC) to capture the subtle chrominance changes for enhancing rPPG estimation.

Supervised learning under a close-set setting and industrial anomaly detection, as two common paradigms in VII, face different problems in practical applications. The former is that various and sufficient defects are difficult to obtain, while the latter is that specific defects cannot be located. To solve these problems, in this paper, we focus on the few-shot semantic segmentation (FSS) method, which can locate unseen defects conditioned on a few annotations without retraining. Compared to common objects in natural images, the defects in VII are small. This brings two problems to current FSS methods: 1 distortion of target semantics and 2 many false positives for backgrounds. To alleviate these problems, we propose a small object few-shot segmentation (SOFS) model. The key idea for alleviating 1 is to avoid the resizing of the original image and correctly indicate the intensity of target semantics. SOFS achieves this idea via the non-resizing procedure and the prototype intensity downsampling of support annotations. To alleviate 2, we design an abnormal prior map in SOFS to guide the model to reduce false positives and propose a mixed normal Dice loss to preferentially prevent the model from predicting false positives. SOFS can achieve FSS and few-shot anomaly detection determined by support masks. Diverse experiments substantiate the superior performance of SOFS. Code is available at this https URL.",

To address this issue, we developed a 3D shape completion network, called CoRe++, which can complete the 3D shape from RGB-D images. CoRe++ is a deep learning network that consists of a convolutional encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses RGB-D images into latent vectors that are used by the decoder to complete the 3D shape using the deep signed distance field network (DeepSDF). To evaluate our CoRe++ network, we collected partial and complete 3D point clouds of 339 potato tubers on an operational harvester in Japan. On the 1425 RGB-D images in the test set (representing 51 unique potato tubers), our network achieved a completion accuracy of 2.8 mm on average. For volumetric estimation, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 22.6 ml, and this was better than the RMSE of the linear regression (31.1 ml) and the base model (36.9 ml). We found that the RMSE can be further reduced to 18.2 ml when performing the 3D shape completion in the center of the RGB-D image.

However, the utilization of vanilla PFH encounters great difficulties when applied to large datasets and dense point clouds, as it demands considerable time for feature generation. In contrast, we introduce the Local Reference Constructor module, which approximates the local coordinate systems based on triangle sets. Owing to this, our OPFR only requires extra 1.56ms for inference (65x faster than vanilla PFH) and 0.012M more parameters, and it can serve as a versatile plug-and-play module for various backbones, particularly MLP-based and Transformer-based backbones examined in this study. Additionally, we introduce the novel Hierarchical Sampling module aimed at enhancing the quality of triangle sets, thereby ensuring robustness of the obtained geometric features. Our proposed method improves overall accuracy (OA) on ModelNet40 from 90.7% to 94.5% (+3.8%) for classification, and OA on S3DIS Area-5 from 86.4% to 90.0% (+3.6%) for semantic segmentation, respectively, building upon PointNet++ backbone. When integrated with Point Transformer backbone, we achieve state-of-the-art results on both tasks: 94.8% OA on ModelNet40 and 91.7% OA on S3DIS Area-5.",

Leveraging the remarkable visual reasoning capabilities of multimodal large language models (MLLMs), recent methods address layout generation in a static manner, lacking the feedback-driven refinement essential for interactive user engagement. We introduce Chat2Layout, a novel interactive furniture layout generation system that extends the functionality of MLLMs into the realm of interactive layout design. To achieve this, we establish a unified vision-question paradigm for in-context learning, enabling seamless communication with MLLMs to steer their behavior without altering model weights. Within this framework, we present a novel training-free visual prompting mechanism. This involves a visual-text prompting technique that assist MLLMs in reasoning about plausible layout plans, followed by an Offline-to-Online search (O2O-Search) method, which automatically identifies the minimal set of informative references to provide exemplars for visual-text prompting. By employing an agent system with MLLMs as the core controller, we enable bidirectional interaction. The agent not only comprehends the 3D environment and user requirements through linguistic and visual perception but also plans tasks and reasons about actions to generate and arrange furniture within the virtual space. Furthermore, the agent iteratively updates based on visual feedback from execution results. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach facilitates language-interactive generation and arrangement for diverse and complex 3D furniture.",

To this end, we present CAMAv2: a vision-centric approach for Consistent and Accurate Map Annotation. Without LiDAR inputs, our proposed framework can still generate high-quality 3D annotations of static map elements. Specifically, the annotation can achieve high reprojection accuracy across all surrounding cameras and is spatial-temporal consistent across the whole sequence. We apply our proposed framework to the popular nuScenes dataset to provide efficient and highly accurate annotations. Compared with the original nuScenes static map element, our CAMAv2 annotations achieve lower reprojection errors (e.g., 4.96 vs. 8.03 pixels).

Many models have been developed to tackle this problem, and recently vision transformers (ViTs) have shown promising results. However, the complexity and large number of trainable parameters of ViTs restrict their deployment in practical applications. This underscores the need for an efficient model that not only reduces trainable parameters but also allows for adjustable complexity based on specific needs while delivering comparable performance. To achieve this, in this paper we introduce an Efficient Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (EUDA) framework. EUDA employs the DINOv2, which is a self-supervised ViT, as a feature extractor followed by a simplified bottleneck of fully connected layers to refine features for enhanced domain adaptation. Additionally, EUDA employs the synergistic domain alignment loss (SDAL), which integrates cross-entropy (CE) and maximum mean discrepancy (MMD) losses, to balance adaptation by minimizing classification errors in the source domain while aligning the source and target domain distributions. The experimental results indicate the effectiveness of EUDA in producing comparable results as compared with other state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptation with significantly fewer trainable parameters, between 42% to 99.7% fewer.

The end-to-end autonomous driving (e2eAD) is one of the typically fields facing new opportunities as the LLMs have supported more and more modalities.

Each stage consists of several visual question answering (VQA) pairs and VQA pairs interconnect with each other constructing a graph called Graph VQA (GVQA). By reasoning each VQA pair in the GVQA through VLM stage by stage, our method could achieve e2e driving with language. In our method, vision transformers (ViT) models are employed to process nuScenes visual data, while VLM are utilized to interpret and reason about the information extracted from the visual inputs. In the perception stage, the system identifies and classifies objects from the driving environment. The prediction stage involves forecasting the potential movements of these objects. The planning stage utilizes the gathered information to develop a driving strategy, ensuring the safety and efficiency of the autonomous vehicle.

        "abstract": "Implicit representation mapping (IRM) can translate image features to any continuous resolution, showcasing its potent capability for ultra-high-resolution image segmentation refinement. Current IRM-based methods for refining ultra-high-resolution image segmentation often rely on CNN-based encoders to extract image features and apply a Shared Implicit Representation Mapping Function (SIRMF) to convert pixel-wise features into segmented results. Hence, these methods exhibit two crucial limitations. Firstly, the CNN-based encoder may not effectively capture long-distance information, resulting in a lack of global semantic information in the pixel-wise features. Secondly, SIRMF is shared across all samples, which limits its ability to generalize and handle diverse inputs. To address these limitations, we propose a novel approach that leverages the newly proposed Adaptive Implicit Representation Mapping (AIRM) for ultra-high-resolution Image Segmentation. Specifically, the proposed method comprises two components: (1) the Affinity Empowered Encoder (AEE), a robust feature extractor that leverages the benefits of the transformer architecture and semantic affinity to model long-distance features effectively, and (2) the Adaptive Implicit Representation Mapping Function (AIRMF), which adaptively translates pixel-wise features without neglecting the global semantic information, allowing for flexible and precise feature translation. We evaluated our method on the commonly used ultra-high-resolution segmentation refinement datasets, i.e., BIG and PASCAL VOC 2012.

Each camera in the setup has a field of view (FOV). Multi-view analysis requires overlap of the FOVs of all cameras, or a significant subset of them. However, the success of such methods is not guaranteed, because the FOVs may not sufficiently overlap. The reason is that pointing of a camera from a mount or platform has some randomness (noise), due to imprecise platform control, typical to mechanical systems, and particularly moving systems such as satellites. So, success is probabilistic. This paper creates a framework to analyze this aspect. This is critical for setting limitations on the capabilities of imaging systems, such as resolution (pixel footprint), FOV, the size of domains that can be captured, and efficiency. The framework uses the fact that imprecise pointing can be mitigated by self-calibration - provided that there is sufficient overlap between pairs of views and sufficient visual similarity of views.

        "title": "Contrastive Factor Analysis",
        "abstract": "Factor analysis, often regarded as a Bayesian variant of matrix factorization, offers superior capabilities in capturing uncertainty, modeling complex dependencies, and ensuring robustness. As the deep learning era arrives, factor analysis is receiving less and less attention due to their limited expressive ability. On the contrary, contrastive learning has emerged as a potent technique with demonstrated efficacy in unsupervised representational learning. While the two methods are different paradigms, recent theoretical analysis has revealed the mathematical equivalence between contrastive learning and matrix factorization, providing a potential possibility for factor analysis combined with contrastive learning. Motivated by the interconnectedness of contrastive learning, matrix factorization, and factor analysis, this paper introduces a novel Contrastive Factor Analysis framework, aiming to leverage factor analysis's advantageous properties within the realm of contrastive learning. To further leverage the interpretability properties of non-negative factor analysis, which can learn disentangled representations, contrastive factor analysis is extended to a non-negative version. Finally, extensive experimental validation showcases the efficacy of the proposed contrastive (non-negative) factor analysis methodology across multiple key properties, including expressiveness, robustness, interpretability, and accurate uncertainty estimation.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) methods are popular since they can address situations with limited annotated data by directly utilising the underlying data distribution. However, the adoption of such methods is not explored enough in ultrasound (US) imaging, especially for fetal assessment. We investigate the potential of dual-encoder SSL in utilizing unlabelled US video data to improve the performance of challenging downstream Standard Fetal Cardiac Planes (SFCP) classification using limited labelled 2D US images. We study 7 SSL approaches based on reconstruction, contrastive loss, distillation, and information theory and evaluate them extensively on a large private US dataset. Our observations and findings are consolidated from more than 500 downstream training experiments under different settings. Our primary observation shows that for SSL training, the variance of the dataset is more crucial than its size because it allows the model to learn generalisable representations, which improve the performance of downstream tasks. Overall, the BarlowTwins method shows robust performance, irrespective of the training settings and data variations, when used as an initialisation for downstream tasks. Notably, full fine-tuning with 1% of labelled data outperforms ImageNet initialisation by 12% in F1-score and outperforms other SSL initialisations by at least 4% in F1-score, thus making it a promising candidate for transfer learning from US video to image data.",

        "abstract": "Medical image segmentation involves identifying and separating object instances in a medical image to delineate various tissues and structures, a task complicated by the significant variations in size, shape, and density of these features. Convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have traditionally been used for this task but have limitations in capturing long-range dependencies. Transformers, equipped with self-attention mechanisms, aim to address this problem. However, in medical image segmentation it is beneficial to merge both local and global features to effectively integrate feature maps across various scales, capturing both detailed features and broader semantic elements for dealing with variations in structures. In this paper, we introduce MSA2Net, a new deep segmentation framework featuring an expedient design of skip-connections. These connections facilitate feature fusion by dynamically weighting and combining coarse-grained encoder features with fine-grained decoder feature maps. Specifically, we propose a Multi-Scale Adaptive Spatial Attention Gate (MASAG), which dynamically adjusts the receptive field (Local and Global contextual information) to ensure that spatially relevant features are selectively highlighted while minimizing background distractions. Extensive evaluations involving dermatology, and radiological datasets demonstrate that our MSA2Net outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) works or matches their performance.

However, mainstream Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks typically assume instructions perfectly align with the fixed and predefined navigation graphs without any obstructions. This assumption overlooks potential discrepancies in actual navigation graphs and given instructions, which can cause major failures for both indoor and outdoor agents. To address this issue, we integrate diverse obstructions into the R2R dataset by modifying both the navigation graphs and visual observations, introducing an innovative dataset and task, R2R with UNexpected Obstructions (R2R-UNO). R2R-UNO contains various types and numbers of path obstructions to generate instruction-reality mismatches for VLN research. Experiments on R2R-UNO reveal that state-of-the-art VLN methods inevitably encounter significant challenges when facing such mismatches, indicating that they rigidly follow instructions rather than navigate adaptively. Therefore, we propose a novel method called ObVLN (Obstructed VLN), which includes a curriculum training strategy and virtual graph construction to help agents effectively adapt to obstructed environments. Empirical results show that ObVLN not only maintains robust performance in unobstructed scenarios but also achieves a substantial performance advantage with unexpected obstructions.",

Therefore, in this study, a novel generative model is proposed, namely Identity-Consistent Radiographic Diffusion Network (IC-RDN), for multifaceted KOA prognosis encompassing a predicted future knee X-ray scan conditioned on the baseline scan. Specifically, an identity prior module for the diffusion and a downstream generation-guided progression prediction module are introduced. Compared to conventional image-to-image generative models, identity priors regularize and guide the diffusion to focus more on the clinical nuances of the prognosis based on a contrastive learning strategy. The progression prediction module utilizes both forecasted and baseline knee scans, and a more comprehensive formulation of KOA severity progression grading is expected.

Traditional methods rely on self-report questionnaires and clinical assessment, lacking objective biomarkers.

In this study, we propose the Spatio-Temporal Aggregation Network (STANet) for diagnosing depression by integrating CNN and RNN to capture both temporal and spatial features of brain activity.

The experimental results demonstrate that STANet achieves superior depression diagnostic performance with 82.38% accuracy and a 90.72% AUC. The STFA module enhances classification by capturing deeper features at multiple scales. The AFGRU classifier, with adaptive weights and stacked GRU, attains higher accuracy and AUC.

However, lack of efficient quantitative tools for evaluating the HFs has deprived ophthalmologist of assessing the volume of HFs. For this reason, we propose an automated quantification algorithm to segment and quantify HFs in spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). The proposed algorithm consists of two parallel processes namely: region of interest (ROI) generation and HFs estimation. To generate the ROI, we use morphological reconstruction to obtain the reconstructed image and histogram constructed for data distributions and clustering. In parallel, we estimate the HFs by extracting the extremal regions from the connected regions obtained from a component tree. Finally, both the ROI and the HFs estimation process are merged to obtain the segmented HFs.

It has been found that the memorization scores from the early layers' embeddings are more sensitive to low-level memorization (e.g. colors and simple patterns for an image), while those from the latter layers are more sensitive to high-level memorization (e.g. semantic meaning of an image). We also observe that, for a specific model architecture, its degree of memorization on different levels of information is unique. It can be viewed as an inherent property of the architecture. Building upon this insight, we introduce a unique fingerprinting methodology. This method capitalizes on the unique distributions of the memorization score across different layers of ViTs, providing a novel approach to identifying models involved in generating deepfakes and malicious content. Our approach demonstrates a marked 30% enhancement in identification accuracy over existing baseline methods, offering a more effective tool for combating digital misinformation.",

        "title": "Domain Shift Analysis in Chest Radiographs Classification in a Veterans Healthcare Administration Population",
        "abstract": "Objectives: This study aims to assess the impact of domain shift on chest X-ray classification accuracy and to analyze the influence of ground truth label quality and demographic factors such as age group, sex, and study year. Materials and Methods: We used a DenseNet121 model pretrained MIMIC-CXR dataset for deep learning-based multilabel classification using ground truth labels from radiology reports extracted using the CheXpert and CheXbert Labeler. We compared the performance of the 14 chest X-ray labels on the MIMIC-CXR and Veterans Healthcare Administration chest X-ray dataset (VA-CXR). The VA-CXR dataset comprises over 259k chest X-ray images spanning between the years 2010 and 2022. Results: The validation of ground truth and the assessment of multi-label classification performance across various NLP extraction tools revealed that the VA-CXR dataset exhibited lower disagreement rates than the MIMIC-CXR datasets. Additionally, there were notable differences in AUC scores between models utilizing CheXpert and CheXbert. When evaluating multi-label classification performance across different datasets, minimal domain shift was observed in unseen datasets, except for the label \"Enlarged Cardiomediastinum.\" The study year's subgroup analyses exhibited the most significant variations in multi-label classification model performance. These findings underscore the importance of considering domain shifts in chest X-ray classification tasks, particularly concerning study years. Conclusion: Our study reveals the significant impact of domain shift and demographic factors on chest X-ray classification, emphasizing the need for improved transfer learning and equitable model development. Addressing these challenges is crucial for advancing medical imaging and enhancing patient care.",

        "title": "Taming the Frequency Factory of Sinusoidal Networks",
        "abstract": "This work investigates the structure and representation capacity of $sinusoidal$ MLPs, which have recently shown promising results in encoding low-dimensional signals. This success can be attributed to its smoothness and high representation capacity. The first allows the use of the network's derivatives during training, enabling regularization. However, defining the architecture and initializing its parameters to achieve a desired capacity remains an empirical task. This work provides theoretical and experimental results justifying the capacity property of sinusoidal MLPs and offers control mechanisms for their initialization and training.\nWe approach this from a Fourier series perspective and link the training with the model's spectrum. Our analysis is based on a $harmonic$ expansion of the sinusoidal MLP, which says that the composition of sinusoidal layers produces a large number of new frequencies expressed as integer linear combinations of the input frequencies (weights of the input layer). We use this novel $identity$ to initialize the input neurons which work as a sampling in the signal spectrum. We also note that each hidden neuron produces the same frequencies with amplitudes completely determined by the hidden weights. Finally, we give an upper bound for these amplitudes, which results in a $bounding$ scheme for the network's spectrum during training.",

        "title": "Multi-Grained Query-Guided Set Prediction Network for Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition",
        "abstract": "Grounded Multimodal Named Entity Recognition (GMNER) is an emerging information extraction (IE) task, aiming to simultaneously extract entity spans, types, and entity-matched bounding box groundings in images from given sentence-image pairs data. Recent unified methods employing machine reading comprehension (MRC-based) frameworks or sequence generation-based models face challenges in understanding the relationships of multimodal entities. MRC-based frameworks, utilizing human-designed queries, struggle to model intra-entity connections. Meanwhile, sequence generation-based outputs excessively rely on inter-entity dependencies due to pre-defined decoding order. To tackle these, we propose a novel unified framework named Multi-grained Query-guided Set Prediction Network (MQSPN) to learn appropriate relationships at intra-entity and inter-entity levels. Specifically, MQSPN consists of a Multi-grained Query Set (MQS) and a Multimodal Set Prediction Network (MSP). MQS combines specific type-grained and learnable entity-grained queries to adaptively strengthen intra-entity connections by explicitly aligning visual regions with textual spans. Based on solid intra-entity modeling, MSP reformulates GMNER as a set prediction, enabling the parallel prediction of multimodal entities in a non-autoregressive manner, eliminating redundant dependencies from preceding sequences, and guiding models to establish appropriate inter-entity relationships from a global matching perspective. Additionally, to boost better alignment of two-level relationships, we also incorporate a Query-guided Fusion Net (QFNet) to work as a glue network between MQS and MSP. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performances in widely used benchmarks. Notably, our method improves 2.83% F1 in the difficult fine-grained GMNER benchmark.",

        "abstract": "Purpose: We aimed to estimate the total lung volume (TLV) from real and synthetic frontal X-ray radiographs on a pixel level using lung thickness maps generated by a U-Net.\nMethods: 5,959 thorax X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans were retrieved from two publicly available datasets of the lung nodule analysis 2016 (n=656) and the RSNA pulmonary embolism detection challenge 2020 (n=5,303). Additionally, thorax CT scans from 72 subjects (33 healthy: 20 men, mean age [range] = 62.4 [34, 80]; 39 suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 25 men, mean age [range] = 69.0 [47, 91]) were retrospectively selected (10.2018-12.2019) from our in-house dataset such that for each subject, a frontal chest X-ray radiograph no older than seven days was available. All CT scans and their corresponding lung segmentation were forward projected using a simulated X-ray spectrum to generate synthetic radiographs and lung thickness maps, respectively. A U-Net model was trained and tested on synthetic radiographs from the public datasets to predict lung thickness maps and consequently estimate TLV. Model performance was further assessed by evaluating the TLV estimations for the in-house synthetic and real radiograph pairs using Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and significance testing.\nResults: Strong correlations were measured between the predicted and CT-derived ground truth TLV values for test data from synthetic ($n_{Public}$=1,191, r=0.987, P < 0.001; $n_{In-house}$=72, r=0.973, P < 0.001) and real radiographs (n=72, r=0.908, P < 0.001).\nConclusion: TLV from U-Net-generated pixel-level lung thickness maps were successfully estimated for synthetic and real radiographs.",

        "abstract": "This paper introduces an agent-based simulation model aimed at understanding urban commuters mode choices and evaluating the impacts of transport policies to promote sustainable mobility. Crafted for developing countries, where utilitarian travel heavily relies on motorcycles, the model integrates sociocultural factors that influence transport behavior. Multinomial models and inferential statistics applied to survey data from Cali, Colombia, inform the model, revealing significant influences of sociodemographic factors and travel attributes on mode choice. Findings highlight the importance of cost, time, safety, comfort, and personal security, with disparities across socioeconomic groups. Policy simulations demonstrate positive responses to interventions like free public transportation, increased bus frequency, and enhanced security, yet with modest shifts in mode choice. Multifaceted policy approaches are deemed more effective, addressing diverse user preferences. Outputs can be extended to cities with similar sociocultural characteristics and transport dynamics. The methodology applied in this work can be replicated for other territories.",

        "title": "Decentralized and Uncoordinated Learning of Stable Matchings: A Game-Theoretic Approach",
        "abstract": "We consider the problem of learning stable matchings in a fully decentralized and uncoordinated manner. In this problem, there are $n$ men and $n$ women, each having preference over the other side. It is assumed that women know their preferences over men, but men are not aware of their preferences over women, and they only learn them if they propose and successfully get matched to women. A matching is called stable if no man and woman prefer each other over their current matches. When all the preferences are known a priori, the celebrated Deferred-Acceptance algorithm proposed by Gale and Shapley provides a decentralized and uncoordinated algorithm to obtain a stable matching. However, when the preferences are unknown, developing such an algorithm faces major challenges due to a lack of coordination. We achieve this goal by making a connection between stable matchings and learning Nash equilibria (NE) in noncooperative games. First, we provide a complete information game formulation for the stable matching problem with known preferences such that its set of pure NE coincides with the set of stable matchings, while its mixed NE can be rounded in a decentralized manner to a stable matching. Relying on such a game-theoretic formulation, we show that for hierarchical markets, adopting the exponential weight (EXP) learning algorithm for the stable matching game achieves logarithmic regret with polynomial dependence on the number of players, thus answering a question posed in previous literature. Moreover, we show that the same EXP learning algorithm converges locally and exponentially fast to a stable matching in general matching markets. We complement this result by introducing another decentralized and uncoordinated learning algorithm that globally converges to a stable matching with arbitrarily high probability, leveraging the weak acyclicity property of the stable matching game.",
