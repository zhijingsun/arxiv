        "title": "CADRL: Category-aware Dual-agent Reinforcement Learning for Explainable Recommendations over Knowledge Graphs",
        "abstract": "Knowledge graphs (KGs) have been widely adopted to mitigate data sparsity and address cold-start issues in recommender systems. While existing KGs-based recommendation methods can predict user preferences and demands, they fall short in generating explicit recommendation paths and lack explainability. As a step beyond the above methods, recent advancements utilize reinforcement learning (RL) to find suitable items for a given user via explainable recommendation paths. However, the performance of these solutions is still limited by the following two points. (1) Lack of ability to capture contextual dependencies from neighboring information. (2) The excessive reliance on short recommendation paths due to efficiency concerns. To surmount these challenges, we propose a category-aware dual-agent reinforcement learning (CADRL) model for explainable recommendations over KGs. Specifically, our model comprises two components: (1) a category-aware gated graph neural network that jointly captures context-aware item representations from neighboring entities and categories, and (2) a dual-agent RL framework where two agents efficiently traverse long paths to search for suitable items. Finally, experimental results show that CADRL outperforms state-of-the-art models in terms of both effectiveness and efficiency on large-scale datasets."

        "abstract": "To cater to users' desire for an immersive browsing experience, numerous e-commerce platforms provide various recommendation scenarios, with a focus on Trigger-Induced Recommendation (TIR) tasks. However, the majority of current TIR methods heavily rely on the trigger item to understand user intent, lacking a higher-level exploration and exploitation of user intent (e.g., popular items and complementary items), which may result in an overly convergent understanding of users' short-term intent and can be detrimental to users' long-term purchasing experiences. Moreover, users' short-term intent shows uncertainty and is affected by various factors such as browsing context and historical behaviors, which poses challenges to user intent modeling. To address these challenges, we propose a novel model called Deep Uncertainty Intent Network (DUIN), comprising three essential modules: i) Explicit Intent Exploit Module extracting explicit user intent using the contrastive learning paradigm; ii) Latent Intent Explore Module exploring latent user intent by leveraging the multi-view relationships between items; iii) Intent Uncertainty Measurement Module offering a distributional estimation and capturing the uncertainty associated with user intent. Experiments on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superior performance of DUIN compared to existing baselines. Notably, DUIN has been deployed across all TIR scenarios in our e-commerce platform, with online A/B testing results conclusively validating its superiority."

        "abstract": "The increasing availability of learning activity data in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) enables us to conduct a large-scale analysis of learners' learning behavior. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of 351 million learning activities from 0.8 million unique learners enrolled in over 1.6 thousand courses within two years. Specifically, we mine and identify the learning patterns of the crowd from both temporal and course enrollment perspectives leveraging mutual information theory and sequential pattern mining methods. From the temporal perspective, we find that the time intervals between consecutive learning activities of learners exhibit a mix of power-law and periodic cosine function distribution. By qualifying the relationship between course pairs, we observe that the most frequently co-enrolled courses usually fall in the same category or the same university. We demonstrate these findings can facilitate manifold applications including recommendation tasks on courses. A simple recommendation model utilizing the course enrollment patterns is competitive to the baselines with 200$\\times$ faster training time."

        "abstract": "In recent years, Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) has played a pivotal role in modern search and recommendation systems, especially in emerging LLM applications like Retrieval-Augmented Generation. There is a growing exploration into harnessing the parallel computing capabilities of GPUs to meet the substantial demands of ANNS. However, existing systems primarily focus on offline scenarios, overlooking the distinct requirements of online applications that necessitate real-time insertion of new vectors. This limitation renders such systems inefficient for real-world scenarios. Moreover, previous architectures struggled to effectively support real-time insertion due to their reliance on serial execution streams. In this paper, we introduce a novel Real-Time Adaptive Multi-Stream GPU ANNS System (RTAMS-GANNS). Our architecture achieves its objectives through three key advancements: 1) We initially examined the real-time insertion mechanisms in existing GPU ANNS systems and discovered their reliance on repetitive copying and memory allocation, which significantly hinders real-time effectiveness on GPUs. As a solution, we introduce a dynamic vector insertion algorithm based on memory blocks, which includes in-place rearrangement. 2) To enable real-time vector insertion in parallel, we introduce a multi-stream parallel execution mode, which differs from existing systems that operate serially within a single stream. Our system utilizes a dynamic resource pool, allowing multiple streams to execute concurrently without additional execution blocking. 3) Through extensive experiments and comparisons, our approach effectively handles varying QPS levels across different datasets, reducing latency by up to 40%-80%. The proposed system has also been deployed in real-world industrial search and recommendation systems, serving hundreds of millions of users daily, and has achieved good results."

Thus, in this research, we aim to create a taxonomy to conceptualize a comprehensive overview of the constituting characteristics that define RAG applications, facilitating the adoption of this technology in the IS community. To the best of our knowledge, no RAG application taxonomies have been developed so far. We describe our methodology for developing the taxonomy, which includes the criteria for selecting papers, an explanation of our rationale for employing a Large Language Model (LLM)-supported approach to extract and identify initial characteristics, and a concise overview of our systematic process for conceptualizing the taxonomy. Our systematic taxonomy development process includes four iterative phases designed to refine and enhance our understanding and presentation of RAG's core dimensions. We have developed a total of five meta-dimensions and sixteen dimensions to comprehensively capture the concept of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) applications.

We focus on a medical KG to demonstrate our methodology, which includes (1) pre-processing, (2) Cypher query generation, (3) Cypher query processing, (4) KG retrieval, and (5) LLM-enhanced response generation. We evaluate our system on a curated dataset of 69 samples, achieving a precision of 78\\% in retrieving correct KG nodes. Our findings indicate that the hybrid system surpasses a standalone LLM in accuracy and completeness, as verified by an LLM-as-a-Judge evaluation method. This positions the system as a promising tool for applications that demand factual correctness and completeness, such as target identification -- a critical process in pinpointing biological entities for disease treatment or crop enhancement. Moreover, its intuitive search interface and ability to provide accurate responses within seconds make it well-suited for time-sensitive, precision-focused research contexts.

However, existing augmentation methods, such as directly perturbing interaction graph (e.g., node/edge dropout), may interfere with the original connections and generate poor contrasting views, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we define the views that share only a small amount of information with the original graph due to poor data augmentation as noisy views (i.e., the last 20% of the views with a cosine similarity value less than 0.1 to the original view). We demonstrate through detailed experiments that noisy views will significantly degrade recommendation performance. Further, we propose a model-agnostic Symmetric Graph Contrastive Learning (SGCL) method with theoretical guarantees to address this issue. Specifically, we introduce symmetry theory into graph contrastive learning, based on which we propose a symmetric form and contrast loss resistant to noisy interference. We provide theoretical proof that our proposed SGCL method has a high tolerance to noisy views. Further demonstration is given by conducting extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially increases recommendation accuracy, with relative improvements reaching as high as 12.25% over nine other competing models. These results highlight the efficacy of our method."

Typically, such problems can be investigated and fixed by on-call engineers, but locating the cause of such problems and fixing errors are often time-consuming. Therefore, automatic data validation is a better solution to defend the system and downstream services by enabling early detection of errors and providing detailed error messages for quick resolution. This paper proposes a self-validate data management system with automatic pattern discovery techniques to verify the correctness of semi-structural string data in enterprise data pipelines. Our solution extracts patterns from historical data and detects erroneous incoming data in a top-down fashion. High-level information of historical data is analyzed to discover the format skeleton of correct values. Fine-grained semantic patterns are then extracted to strike a balance between generalization and specification of the discovered pattern, thus covering as many correct values as possible while avoiding over-fitting. To tackle cold start and rapid data growth, we propose an incremental update strategy and example generalization strategy. Experiments on large-scale industrial and public datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method compared to alternative solutions. Furthermore, a case study on an industrial platform (Ant Group Inc.) with thousands of applications shows that our system captures meaningful data patterns in daily operations and helps engineers quickly identify errors."

Designing private analytic algorithms for different graph queries often requires starting from scratch. In contrast, differentially private synthetic graph generation offers a general paradigm that supports one-time generation for multiple queries. Although a rich set of differentially private graph generation algorithms has been proposed, comparing them effectively remains challenging due to various factors, including differing privacy definitions, diverse graph datasets, varied privacy requirements, and multiple utility metrics.\nTo this end, we propose PGB (Private Graph Benchmark), a comprehensive benchmark designed to enable researchers to compare differentially private graph generation algorithms fairly. We begin by identifying four essential elements of existing works as a 4-tuple: mechanisms, graph datasets, privacy requirements, and utility metrics. We discuss principles regarding these elements to ensure the comprehensiveness of a benchmark. Next, we present a benchmark instantiation that adheres to all principles, establishing a new method to evaluate existing and newly proposed graph generation algorithms. Through extensive theoretical and empirical analysis, we gain valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of prior algorithms. Our results indicate that there is no universal solution for all possible cases. Finally, we provide guidelines to help researchers select appropriate mechanisms for various scenarios."

MAPF-LNS, based on Large Neighborhood Search (LNS), is the current state-of-the-art approach where a fast initial solution is iteratively optimized by destroying and repairing selected paths of the solution. Current MAPF-LNS variants commonly use an adaptive selection mechanism to choose among multiple destroy heuristics. However, to determine promising destroy heuristics, MAPF-LNS requires a considerable amount of exploration time. As common destroy heuristics are non-adaptive, any performance bottleneck caused by these heuristics cannot be overcome via adaptive heuristic selection alone, thus limiting the overall effectiveness of MAPF-LNS in terms of solution cost. In this paper, we propose Adaptive Delay-based Destroy-and-Repair Enhanced with Success-based Self-Learning (ADDRESS) as a single-destroy-heuristic variant of MAPF-LNS. ADDRESS applies restricted Thompson Sampling to the top-K set of the most delayed agents to select a seed agent for adaptive LNS neighborhood generation. We evaluate ADDRESS in multiple maps from the MAPF benchmark set and demonstrate cost improvements by at least 50% in large-scale scenarios with up to a thousand agents, compared with the original MAPF-LNS and other state-of-the-art methods."

By providing a few contextual demonstrations, developers can utilize the extensive internal knowledge of LLMs to effortlessly translate complex tasks described in abstract language into sequences of code snippets, which will serve as the execution logic for embodied agents. However, this paper uncovers a significant backdoor security threat within this process and introduces a novel method called \\method{}. By poisoning just a few contextual demonstrations, attackers can covertly compromise the contextual environment of a black-box LLM, prompting it to generate programs with context-dependent defects. These programs appear logically sound but contain defects that can activate and induce unintended behaviors when the operational agent encounters specific triggers in its interactive environment. To compromise the LLM's contextual environment, we employ adversarial in-context generation to optimize poisoned demonstrations, where an LLM judge evaluates these poisoned prompts, reporting to an additional LLM that iteratively optimizes the demonstration in a two-player adversarial game using chain-of-thought reasoning. To enable context-dependent behaviors in downstream agents, we implement a dual-modality activation strategy that controls both the generation and execution of program defects through textual and visual triggers. We expand the scope of our attack by developing five program defect modes that compromise key aspects of confidentiality, integrity, and availability in embodied agents. To validate the effectiveness of our approach, we conducted extensive experiments across various tasks, including robot planning, robot manipulation, and compositional visual reasoning. Additionally, we demonstrate the potential impact of our approach by successfully attacking real-world autonomous driving systems."

The more popular ones, such as Chat-GPT, are trained on large amounts of Internet data. However, it is becoming apparent that this data is likely to be exhausted soon, and technology companies are looking for new sources of data to train the next generation of foundation models.\nReinforcement learning, RAG, prompt engineering and cognitive modelling are often used to fine-tune and augment the behaviour of foundation models. These techniques have been used to replicate people, such as Caryn Marjorie. These chatbots are not based on people's actual emotional and physiological responses to their environment, so they are, at best, a surface-level approximation to the characters they are imitating.\nTo address these issues, we have developed a recording rig that captures what the wearer is seeing and hearing as well as their skin conductance (GSR), facial expression and brain state (14 channel EEG). AI algorithms are used to process this data into a rich picture of the environment and internal states of the subject. Foundation models trained on this data could replicate human behaviour much more accurately than the personality models that have been developed so far. This type of model has many potential applications, including recommendation, personal assistance, GAN systems, dating and recruitment.\nThis paper gives some background to this work and describes the recording rig and preliminary tests of its functionality. It then suggests how a new type of foundation model could be created from the data captured by the rig and outlines some applications. Data gathering and model training are expensive, so we are currently working on the launch of a start-up that could raise funds for the next stage of the project."

Here we focus on hedges in an experimentally parameterized corpus of 63 Roadrunner cartoon narratives spontaneously produced from memory by 21 speakers for co-present addressees, transcribed to text (Galati and Brennan, 2010). We created a gold standard of hedges annotated by human coders (the Roadrunner-Hedge corpus) and compared three LLM-based approaches for hedge detection: fine-tuning BERT, and zero and few-shot prompting with GPT-4o and LLaMA-3. The best-performing approach was a fine-tuned BERT model, followed by few-shot GPT-4o. After an error analysis on the top performing approaches, we used an LLM-in-the-Loop approach to improve the gold standard coding, as well as to highlight cases in which hedges are ambiguous in linguistically interesting ways that will guide future research.

Our human-in-the-loop approach streamlines annotation, achieving equal quality with up to 75% less manual input required. Moreover, during the refinement process, the relative improvement of our methodology over pure manual labeling reaches peak values of up to 26%, attaining drastically better quality quicker.

However, the gap between benchmark performances and practical usability remains a significant challenge. This paper presents a study aimed at understanding blind users' interaction with object recognition systems for identifying and avoiding errors. Leveraging a pre-existing object recognition system, URCam, fine-tuned for our experiment, we conducted a user study involving 12 blind and low-vision participants. Through in-depth interviews and hands-on error identification tasks, we gained insights into users' experiences, challenges, and strategies for identifying errors in camera-based assistive technologies and object recognition systems. During interviews, many participants preferred independent error review, while expressing apprehension toward misrecognitions. In the error identification task, participants varied viewpoints, backgrounds, and object sizes in their images to avoid and overcome errors. Even after repeating the task, participants identified only half of the errors, and the proportion of errors identified did not significantly differ from their first attempts. Based on these insights, we offer implications for designing accessible interfaces tailored to the needs of blind and low-vision users in identifying object recognition errors."

However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric supporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge conflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance the knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused on refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless, due to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives, models fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors in the intricate and realistic retrieval scenarios. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization, dubbed KaPO, aimed at achieving controllable knowledge selection in real retrieval scenarios. Concretely, we explore and simulate error types across diverse context combinations and learn how to avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods. Simultaneously, by adjusting the balance between response length and the proportion of preference data representing different behavior patterns, we enhance the adherence capabilities and noise robustness of LLMs in a balanced manner. Experimental results show that KaPO outperforms previous methods for handling knowledge conflicts by over 37%, while also exhibiting robust generalization across various out-of-distribution datasets."

A crucial issue is the lack of sufficient data from real industry designs to train these networks. Additionally, there is no methodology to explain a high-drop pixel in a predicted IR drop image to its specific root-causes. In this work, we first propose a U-Net neural network model with attention gates which is specifically tailored to achieve fast and accurate image-based static IR drop prediction. Attention gates allow selective emphasis on relevant parts of the input data without supervision which is desired because of the often sparse nature of the IR drop map. We propose a two-phase training process which utilizes a mix of artificially-generated data and a limited number of points from real designs. The results are, on-average, 18% (53%) better in MAE and 14% (113%) in F1 score compared to the winner of the ICCAD 2023 contest (and U-Net only) when tested on real designs. Second, we propose a fast method using saliency maps which can explain a predicted IR drop in terms of specific input pixels contributing the most to a drop. In our experiments, we show the number of high IR drop pixels can be reduced on-average by 18% by mimicking upsize of a tiny portion of PDN's resistive edges."

Starting from an atomic test objective, StructEval deepens and broadens the evaluation by conducting a structured assessment across multiple cognitive levels and critical concepts, and therefore offers a comprehensive, robust and consistent evaluation for LLMs. Experiments on three widely-used benchmarks demonstrate that StructEval serves as a reliable tool for resisting the risk of data contamination and reducing the interference of potential biases, thereby providing more reliable and consistent conclusions regarding model capabilities.

A critical aspect of compression in practice is model comparison, including tracking many compression experiments, identifying subtle changes in model behavior, and negotiating complex accuracy-efficiency trade-offs. However, existing compression tools poorly support comparison, leading to tedious and, sometimes, incomplete analyses spread across disjoint tools. To support real-world comparative workflows, we develop an interactive visual system called Compress and Compare. Within a single interface, Compress and Compare surfaces promising compression strategies by visualizing provenance relationships between compressed models and reveals compression-induced behavior changes by comparing models' predictions, weights, and activations. We demonstrate how Compress and Compare supports common compression analysis tasks through two case studies, debugging failed compression on generative language models and identifying compression artifacts in image classification models. We further evaluate Compress and Compare in a user study with eight compression experts, illustrating its potential to provide structure to compression workflows, help practitioners build intuition about compression, and encourage thorough analysis of compression's effect on model behavior. Through these evaluations, we identify compression-specific challenges that future visual analytics tools should consider and Compress and Compare visualizations that may generalize to broader model comparison tasks."

Through an analysis of LLMs' internal factual recall at each reasoning step via Knowledge Neurons, we reveal that LLMs fail to harness the critical factual associations under certain circumstances. Instead, they tend to opt for alternative, shortcut-like pathways to answer reasoning questions. By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation. Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks. Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning. Furthermore, we explored how contextual conflicts affect the retrieval of facts during the reasoning process to gain a comprehensive understanding of the factual recall behaviors of LLMs. Code and data will be available soon."

        "title": "Personalizing Federated Instrument Segmentation with Visual Trait Priors in Robotic Surgery",
        "abstract": "Personalized federated learning (PFL) for surgical instrument segmentation (SIS) is a promising approach. It enables multiple clinical sites to collaboratively train a series of models in privacy, with each model tailored to the individual distribution of each site. Existing PFL methods rarely consider the personalization of multi-headed self-attention, and do not account for appearance diversity and instrument shape similarity, both inherent in surgical scenes. We thus propose PFedSIS, a novel PFL method with visual trait priors for SIS, incorporating global-personalized disentanglement (GPD), appearance-regulation personalized enhancement (APE), and shape-similarity global enhancement (SGE), to boost SIS performance in each site. GPD represents the first attempt at head-wise assignment for multi-headed self-attention personalization. To preserve the unique appearance representation of each site and gradually leverage the inter-site difference, APE introduces appearance regulation and provides customized layer-wise aggregation solutions via hypernetworks for each site's personalized parameters. The mutual shape information of instruments is maintained and shared via SGE, which enhances the cross-style shape consistency on the image level and computes the shape-similarity contribution of each site on the prediction level for updating the global parameters. PFedSIS outperforms state-of-the-art methods with +1.51% Dice, +2.11% IoU, -2.79 ASSD, -15.55 HD95 performance gains. The corresponding code and models will be released at this https URL."

        "abstract": "Evaluating the decision-making system is indispensable in developing autonomous vehicles, while realistic and challenging safety-critical test scenarios play a crucial role. Obtaining these scenarios is non-trivial, thanks to the long-tailed distribution, sparsity, and rarity in real-world data sets. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we introduce a natural adversarial scenario generation solution using naturalistic human driving priors and reinforcement learning techniques. By doing this, we can obtain large-scale test scenarios that are both diverse and realistic. Specifically, we build a simulation environment that mimics natural traffic interaction scenarios. Informed by this environment, we implement a two-stage procedure. The first stage incorporates conventional rule-based models, e.g., IDM~(Intelligent Driver Model) and MOBIL~(Minimizing Overall Braking Induced by Lane changes) model, to coarsely and discretely capture and calibrate key control parameters from the real-world dataset. Next, we leverage GAIL~(Generative Adversarial Imitation Learning) to represent driver behaviors continuously. The derived GAIL can be further used to design a PPO~(Proximal Policy Optimization)-based actor-critic network framework to fine-tune the reward function, and then optimizes our natural adversarial scenario generation solution. Extensive experiments have been conducted in the NGSIM dataset including the trajectory of 3,000 vehicles. Essential traffic parameters were measured in comparison with the baseline model, e.g., the collision rate, accelerations, steering, and the number of lane changes. Our findings demonstrate that the proposed model can generate realistic safety-critical test scenarios covering both naturalness and adversariality, which can be a cornerstone for the development of autonomous vehicles."

        "abstract": "Miniaturized cyber-physical systems (CPSes) powered by tiny machine learning (TinyML), such as nano-drones, are becoming an increasingly attractive technology. Their small form factor (i.e., ~10cm diameter) ensures vast applicability, ranging from the exploration of narrow disaster scenarios to safe human-robot interaction. Simple electronics make these CPSes inexpensive, but strongly limit the computational, memory, and sensing resources available on board. In real-world applications, these limitations are further exacerbated by domain shift. This fundamental machine learning problem implies that model perception performance drops when moving from the training domain to a different deployment one. To cope with and mitigate this general problem, we present a novel on-device fine-tuning approach that relies only on the limited ultra-low power resources available aboard nano-drones. Then, to overcome the lack of ground-truth training labels aboard our CPS, we also employ a self-supervised method based on ego-motion consistency. Albeit our work builds on top of a specific real-world vision-based human pose estimation task, it is widely applicable for many embedded TinyML use cases. Our 512-image on-device training procedure is fully deployed aboard an ultra-low power GWT GAP9 System-on-Chip and requires only 1MB of memory while consuming as low as 19mW or running in just 510ms (at 38mW). Finally, we demonstrate the benefits of our on-device learning approach by field-testing our closed-loop CPS, showing a reduction in horizontal position error of up to 26% vs. a non-fine-tuned state-of-the-art baseline. In the most challenging never-seen-before environment, our on-device learning procedure makes the difference between succeeding or failing the mission."

        "abstract": "Dilated Convolution with Learnable Spacing (DCLS) is a recent advanced convolution method that allows enlarging the receptive fields (RF) without increasing the number of parameters, like the dilated convolution, yet without imposing a regular grid. DCLS has been shown to outperform the standard and dilated convolutions on several computer vision benchmarks. Here, we show that, in addition, DCLS increases the models' interpretability, defined as the alignment with human visual strategies. To quantify it, we use the Spearman correlation between the models' GradCAM heatmaps and the ClickMe dataset heatmaps, which reflect human visual attention. We took eight reference models - ResNet50, ConvNeXt (T, S and B), CAFormer, ConvFormer, and FastViT (sa 24 and 36) - and drop-in replaced the standard convolution layers with DCLS ones. This improved the interpretability score in seven of them. Moreover, we observed that Grad-CAM generated random heatmaps for two models in our study: CAFormer and ConvFormer models, leading to low interpretability scores. We addressed this issue by introducing Threshold-Grad-CAM, a modification built on top of Grad-CAM that enhanced interpretability across nearly all models.

Such assistants must be able to 1) encode relevant visual history from the assistant's sensors, e.g., camera, 2) forecast future actions for accomplishing the activity, and 3) replan based on the user in the loop. To evaluate the first two capabilities, grounding visual history and forecasting in short and long horizons, we conduct benchmarking of two prominent classes of multimodal LLM approaches -- Socratic Models and Vision Conditioned Language Models (VCLMs) on video-based action anticipation tasks using offline datasets. These offline benchmarks, however, do not allow us to close the loop with the user, which is essential to evaluate the replanning capabilities and measure successful activity completion in assistive scenarios. To that end, we conduct a first-of-its-kind user study, with 18 participants performing 3 different multi-step cooking activities while wearing an egocentric observation device called Aria and following assistance from multimodal LLMs. We find that the Socratic approach outperforms VCLMs in both offline and online settings. We further highlight how grounding long visual history, common in activity assistance, remains challenging in current models, especially for VCLMs, and demonstrate that offline metrics do not indicate online performance."

We produce probably approximately correct (PAC) guarantees for the performance of these learned policies in a new, unseen environment over the unknown distribution. Our approach is based on finite samples of the MDP environments, for each of which we build an approximation of the model as an interval MDP, by exploring a set of generated trajectories. We use the built approximations to synthesise a single policy that performs well (meets given requirements) across the sampled environments, and furthermore bound its risk (of not meeting the given requirements) when deployed in an unseen environment. Our procedure offers a trade-off between the guaranteed performance of the learned policy and the risk of not meeting the guarantee in an unseen environment. Our approach exploits knowledge of the environment's state space and graph structure, and we show how additional knowledge of its parametric structure can be leveraged to optimize learning and to obtain tighter guarantees from less samples. We evaluate our approach on a diverse range of established benchmarks, demonstrating that we can generate highly performing and robust policies, along with guarantees that tightly quantify their performance and the associated risk."

Despite ChatGPT's recent success, fine-tuning small models remains the best approach for the ECE task. However, existing fine-tuning based ECE methods cannot address all three key challenges in ECE simultaneously: 1) Complex Causality Extraction, where multiple causal-effect pairs occur within a single sentence; 2) Subtask~ Interaction, which involves modeling the mutual dependence between the two subtasks of ECE, i.e., extracting events and identifying the causal relationship between extracted events; and 3) Knowledge Fusion, which requires effectively fusing the knowledge in two modalities, i.e., the expressive pretrained language models and the structured knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a unified ECE framework (UniCE to address all three issues in ECE simultaneously. Specifically, we design a subtask interaction mechanism to enable mutual interaction between the two ECE subtasks. Besides, we design a knowledge fusion mechanism to fuse knowledge in the two modalities. Furthermore, we employ separate decoders for each subtask to facilitate complex causality extraction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms ChatGPT with a margin of at least 30% F1-score.

While Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, its implementation in endoscopic procedures presents significant challenges due to hardware limitations, such as the use of a monocular camera and the absence of odometry sensors. This study presents a robust deep learning-based SLAM approach that combines state-of-the-art and newly developed models. It consists of three main parts: the Monocular Pose Estimation Module that introduces a novel unsupervised method based on the CycleGAN architecture, the Monocular Depth Estimation Module that leverages the novel Zoe architecture, and the 3D Reconstruction Module which uses information from the previous models to create a coherent surgical map. The performance of the procedure was rigorously evaluated using three publicly available datasets (Hamlyn, EndoSLAM, and SCARED) and benchmarked against two state-of-the-art methods, EndoSFMLearner and EndoDepth. The integration of Zoe in the MDEM demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art depth estimation algorithms in endoscopy, whereas the novel approach in the MPEM exhibited competitive performance and the lowest inference time. The results showcase the robustness of our approach in laparoscopy, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy, three different scenarios in endoscopic surgery. The proposed SLAM approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of endoscopic procedures by providing surgeons with enhanced depth perception and 3D reconstruction capabilities."

To achieve self-adaptive and highly efficient reward shaping, we propose a novel method that incorporates success rates derived from historical experiences into shaped rewards. Our approach utilizes success rates sampled from Beta distributions, which dynamically evolve from uncertain to reliable values as more data is collected. Initially, the self-adaptive success rates exhibit more randomness to encourage exploration. Over time, they become more certain to enhance exploitation, thus achieving a better balance between exploration and exploitation. We employ Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) combined with Random Fourier Features (RFF) to derive the Beta distributions, resulting in a computationally efficient implementation in high-dimensional continuous state spaces. This method provides a non-parametric and learning-free approach. The proposed method is evaluated on a wide range of continuous control tasks with sparse and delayed rewards, demonstrating significant improvements in sample efficiency and convergence stability compared to several baselines."

Previous methods mainly focus on using maximum likelihood estimation as the optimization objective for training response generation models, without taking into account the empathy level alignment between generated responses and target responses. To this end, we propose an empathetic response generation using reinforcement learning (EmpRL) framework. The framework designs an effective empathy reward function and generates empathetic responses by maximizing the expected reward through reinforcement learning. Given the powerful text generation capability of pre-trained language models, EmpRL utilizes the pre-trained T5 model as the generator and conducts further training to initialize the policy. To align the empathy level between generated responses and target responses in the context, an empathy reward function containing three empathy communication mechanisms, i.e., emotional reaction, interpretation, and exploration, is constructed using pre-designed and pre-trained empathy identifiers. Finally, the proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to further train the policy to produce empathetic responses. Both automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate that the proposed EmpRL framework can improve the quality of generated responses, enhance the empathy level similarity between generated and target responses, and produce empathetic responses covering both affective and cognitive aspects."

To tackle this challenge, this paper studies the few-shot scooping problem and proposes a vision-based adaptive scooping strategy that uses the deep kernel Gaussian process method trained with a novel meta-training strategy to learn online from very limited experience on out-of-distribution target terrains. Our Deep Kernel Calibration with Maximal Deployment Gaps (kCMD) strategy explicitly trains a deep kernel model to adapt to large domain shifts by creating simulated maximal deployment gaps from an offline training dataset and training models to overcome these deployment gaps during training. Employed in a Bayesian Optimization sequential decision-making framework, the proposed method allows the robot to perform high-quality scooping actions on out-of-distribution terrains after a few attempts, significantly outperforming non-adaptive methods proposed in the excavation literature as well as other state-of-the-art meta-learning methods. The proposed method also demonstrates zero-shot transfer capability, successfully adapting to the NASA OWLAT platform, which serves as a state-of-the-art simulator for potential future planetary missions. These results demonstrate the potential of training deep models with simulated deployment gaps for more generalizable meta-learning in high-capacity models.

Given the intense efforts by leading labs to train and deploy increasingly larger and more capable LLMs, it is critical to ask if the risk of data poisoning will be naturally mitigated by scale, or if it is an increasing threat. We consider three threat models by which data poisoning can occur: malicious fine-tuning, imperfect data curation, and intentional data contamination. Our experiments evaluate the effects of data poisoning on 23 frontier LLMs ranging from 1.5-72 billion parameters on three datasets which speak to each of our threat models. We find that larger LLMs are increasingly vulnerable, learning harmful behavior -- including sleeper agent behavior -- significantly more quickly than smaller LLMs with even minimal data poisoning. These results underscore the need for robust safeguards against data poisoning in larger LLMs."

Marcus theorem states that a strictly positive symmetric matrix can be transformed into a doubly stochastic symmetric matrix by diagonal matrices. However, in clustering, learning sparse matrices is crucial for computational efficiency. We extend Marcus theorem by proposing the Marcus mapping, which indicates that certain sparse matrices can also be transformed into doubly stochastic symmetric matrices via diagonal matrices. Additionally, we introduce rank constraints into the clustering problem and propose the Doubly Stochastic Adaptive Neighbors Clustering algorithm based on the Marcus Mapping (ANCMM). This ensures that the learned graph naturally divides into the desired number of clusters. We validate the effectiveness of our algorithm through extensive comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms. Finally, we explore the relationship between the Marcus mapping and optimal transport. We prove that the Marcus mapping solves a specific type of optimal transport problem and demonstrate that solving this problem through Marcus mapping is more efficient than directly applying optimal transport methods."

        "abstract": "The \"small agent, big world\" frame offers a conceptual view that motivates the need for continual learning. The idea is that a small agent operating in a much bigger world cannot store all information that the world has to offer. To perform well, the agent must be carefully designed to ingest, retain, and eject the right information. To enable the development of performant continual learning agents, a number of synthetic environments have been proposed. However, these benchmarks suffer from limitations, including unnatural distribution shifts and a lack of fidelity to the \"small agent, big world\" framing. This paper aims to formalize two desiderata for the design of future simulated environments. These two criteria aim to reflect the objectives and complexity of continual learning in practical settings while enabling rapid prototyping of algorithms on a smaller scale."

        "abstract": "Data serves as the fundamental foundation for advancing deep learning, particularly tabular data presented in a structured format, which is highly conducive to modeling. However, even in the era of LLM, obtaining tabular data from sensitive domains remains a challenge due to privacy or copyright concerns. Hence, exploring how to effectively use models like LLMs to generate realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data is urgent. In this paper, we take a step forward to explore LLMs for tabular data synthesis and privacy protection, by introducing a new framework HARMONIC for tabular data generation and evaluation. In the tabular data generation of our framework, unlike previous small-scale LLM-based methods that rely on continued pre-training, we explore the larger-scale LLMs with fine-tuning to generate tabular data and enhance privacy. Based on idea of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, an instruction fine-tuning dataset is constructed to inspire LLMs to discover inter-row relationships. Then, with fine-tuning, LLMs are trained to remember the format and connections of the data rather than the data itself, which reduces the risk of privacy leakage. In the evaluation part of our framework, we develop specific privacy risk metrics DLT for LLM synthetic data generation, as well as performance evaluation metrics LLE for downstream LLM tasks. Our experiments find that this tabular data generation framework achieves equivalent performance to existing methods with better privacy, which also demonstrates our evaluation framework for the effectiveness of synthetic data and privacy risks in LLM scenarios."

        "abstract": "Online Imitation Learning methods struggle with the gap between extensive online exploration space and limited expert trajectories, which hinder efficient exploration due to inaccurate task-aware reward estimation. Inspired by the findings from cognitive neuroscience that task decomposition could facilitate cognitive processing for efficient learning, we hypothesize that an agent could estimate precise task-aware imitation rewards for efficient online exploration by decomposing the target task into the objectives of \"what to do\" and the mechanisms of \"how to do\". In this work, we introduce the hybrid Key-state guided Online Imitation (KOI) learning approach, which leverages the integration of semantic and motion key states as guidance for task-aware reward estimation. Initially, we utilize the visual-language models to segment the expert trajectory into semantic key states, indicating the objectives of \"what to do\". Within the intervals between semantic key states, optical flow is employed to capture motion key states to understand the process of \"how to do\". By integrating a thorough grasp of both semantic and motion key states, we refine the trajectory-matching reward computation, encouraging task-aware exploration for efficient online imitation learning. Our experiment results prove that our method is more sample efficient in the Meta-World and LIBERO environments. We also conduct real-world robotic manipulation experiments to validate the efficacy of our method, demonstrating the practical applicability of our KOI method."

Recognizing the unavailability of raw ECG signals in many clinical settings, we propose VizECGNet, which uses only printed ECG graphics to determine the prognosis of multiple cardiovascular diseases. During training, cross-modal attention modules (CMAM) are used to integrate information from two modalities - image and signal, while self-modality attention modules (SMAM) capture inherent long-range dependencies in ECG data of each modality. Additionally, we utilize knowledge distillation to improve the similarity between two distinct predictions from each modality stream. This innovative multi-modal deep learning architecture enables the utilization of only ECG images during inference. VizECGNet with image input achieves higher performance in precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to signal-based ECG classification models, with improvements of 3.50%, 8.21%, and 7.38%, respectively."

This approach not only demonstrates the feasibility of LLM-driven model identification but also reveals insights into the semantic manifolds of different LLM families.

        "abstract": "Preference elicitation frameworks feature heavily in the research on participatory ethical AI tools and provide a viable mechanism to enquire and incorporate the moral values of various stakeholders. As part of the elicitation process, surveys about moral preferences, opinions, and judgments are typically administered only once to each participant. This methodological practice is reasonable if participants' responses are stable over time such that, all other relevant factors being held constant, their responses today will be the same as their responses to the same questions at a later time. However, we do not know how often that is the case. It is possible that participants' true moral preferences change, are subject to temporary moods or whims, or are influenced by environmental factors we don't track. If participants' moral responses are unstable in such ways, it would raise important methodological and theoretical issues for how participants' true moral preferences, opinions, and judgments can be ascertained. We address this possibility here by asking the same survey participants the same moral questions about which patient should receive a kidney when only one is available ten times in ten different sessions over two weeks, varying only presentation order across sessions. We measured how often participants gave different responses to simple (Study One) and more complicated (Study Two) repeated scenarios. On average, the fraction of times participants changed their responses to controversial scenarios was around 10-18% across studies, and this instability is observed to have positive associations with response time and decision-making difficulty. We discuss the implications of these results for the efficacy of moral preference elicitation, highlighting the role of response instability in causing value misalignment between stakeholders and AI tools trained on their moral judgments."

These models hold the potential to advance critical tasks such as few-shot classification, slide retrieval, and patient stratification. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from small images (e.g., 224 x 224 patches) to entire slides, usually by aligning two different augmentations (or views) of the slide. Yet the resulting representation remains constrained by the limited clinical and biological diversity of the views. Instead, we postulate that slides stained with multiple markers, such as immunohistochemistry, can be used as different views to form a rich task-agnostic training signal. To this end, we introduce Madeleine, a multimodal pretraining strategy for slide representation learning. Madeleine is trained with a dual global-local cross-stain alignment objective on large cohorts of breast cancer samples (N=4,211 WSIs across five stains) and kidney transplant samples (N=12,070 WSIs across four stains). We demonstrate the quality of slide representations learned by Madeleine on various downstream evaluations, ranging from morphological and molecular classification to prognostic prediction, comprising 21 tasks using 7,299 WSIs from multiple medical centers.

We then employ our framework to study how face and politeness interact with gender and power in discussions between Wikipedia editors. Among other findings, we observe that female Wikipedians are not only more polite, which is consistent with prior studies, but that this difference corresponds with significantly more language directed at humbling aspects of their own face.

Our insight is that since contemporary generative models learn an accurate representation of their training data, we can use them to summarize the data by mining for visual patterns. Concretely, we show that after finetuning conditional diffusion models to synthesize images from a specific dataset, we can use these models to define a typicality measure on that dataset. This measure assesses how typical visual elements are for different data labels, such as geographic location, time stamps, semantic labels, or even the presence of a disease. This analysis-by-synthesis approach to data mining has two key advantages. First, it scales much better than traditional correspondence-based approaches since it does not require explicitly comparing all pairs of visual elements. Second, while most previous works on visual data mining focus on a single dataset, our approach works on diverse datasets in terms of content and scale, including a historical car dataset, a historical face dataset, a large worldwide street-view dataset, and an even larger scene dataset. Furthermore, our approach allows for translating visual elements across class labels and analyzing consistent changes."

However, the success of deep learning is all attributed to the training on large-scale datasets. Such a large amount of data brings huge pressure on storage, transmission and model training. In order to solve the problem of large amount of data, some researchers put forward the method of data distillation, which aims to compress large training data into smaller synthetic datasets to maintain its performance. While numerous data distillation techniques have been developed within the realm of image processing, the unique characteristics of signals set them apart. Signals exhibit distinct features across various domains, necessitating specialized approaches for their analysis and processing. To this end, a novel dataset distillation method--Multi-domain Distribution Matching (MDM) is proposed. MDM employs the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) to translate timedomain signals into the frequency domain, and then uses a model to compute distribution matching losses between the synthetic and real datasets, considering both the time and frequency domains. Ultimately, these two losses are integrated to update the synthetic dataset. We conduct extensive experiments on three AMR datasets. Experimental results show that, compared with baseline methods, our method achieves better performance under the same compression ratio. Furthermore, we conduct crossarchitecture generalization experiments on several models, and the experimental results show that our synthetic datasets can generalize well on other unseen models."

To enable reliable navigation in augmented surgery, modeling of intraoperative deformation to obtain an accurate alignment of the preoperative organ model with the intraoperative anatomy is indispensable. Despite the existence of various methods proposed to model intraoperative organ deformation, there are still few literature reviews that systematically categorize and summarize these approaches. This review aims to fill this gap by providing a comprehensive and technical-oriented overview of modeling methods for intraoperative organ deformation in augmented reality in surgery. Through a systematic search and screening process, 112 closely relevant papers were included in this review.

Traditional deep learning models, on the other hand, frequently lack interpretability and omit to take prediction uncertainty into account two crucial components of clinical decision making. In order to produce explainable and uncertainty aware predictions, this study presents a novel framework called Bayesian Kolmogorov Arnold Networks (BKANs), which combines the expressive capacity of Kolmogorov Arnold Networks with Bayesian inference. We employ BKANs on two medical datasets, which are widely used benchmarks for assessing machine learning models in medical diagnostics: the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset and the Cleveland Heart Disease dataset. Our method provides useful insights into prediction confidence and decision boundaries and outperforms traditional deep learning models in terms of prediction accuracy. Moreover, BKANs' capacity to represent aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty guarantees doctors receive more solid and trustworthy decision support. Our Bayesian strategy improves the interpretability of the model and considerably minimises overfitting, which is important for tiny and imbalanced medical datasets, according to experimental results. We present possible expansions to further use BKANs in more complicated multimodal datasets and address the significance of these discoveries for future research in building reliable AI systems for healthcare.

Many network embedding methods have been proposed, among which factorization of the Personalized PageRank (PPR for short) matrix has been empirically and theoretically well supported recently. However, several fundamental issues cannot be addressed. (1) Existing methods invoke a seminal Local Push subroutine to approximate \\textit{a single} row or column of the PPR matrix. Thus, they have to execute $n$ ($n$ is the number of nodes) Local Push subroutines to obtain a provable PPR matrix, resulting in prohibitively high computational costs for large $n$. (2) The PPR matrix has limited power in capturing the structural similarity between vertices, leading to performance degradation. To overcome these dilemmas, we propose PSNE, an efficient spectral s\\textbf{P}arsification method for \\textbf{S}caling \\textbf{N}etwork \\textbf{E}mbedding, which can fast obtain the embedding vectors that retain strong structural similarities. Specifically, PSNE first designs a matrix polynomial sparser to accelerate the calculation of the PPR matrix, which has a theoretical guarantee in terms of the Frobenius norm. Subsequently, PSNE proposes a simple but effective multiple-perspective strategy to enhance further the representation power of the obtained approximate PPR matrix. Finally, PSNE applies a randomized singular value decomposition algorithm on the sparse and multiple-perspective PPR matrix to get the target embedding vectors. Experimental evaluation of real-world and synthetic datasets shows that our solutions are indeed more efficient, effective, and scalable compared with ten competitors."

To address this problem, this study proposes a spatial-temporal graph convolutional networks with diversified transformation (STGCNDT), which includes three aspects: a) constructing a unified graph tensor convolutional network (GTCN) using tensor M-products without the need to represent spatiotemporal information separately; b) introducing three transformation schemes in GTCN to model complex temporal patterns to aggregate temporal information; and c) constructing an ensemble of diversified transformation schemes to obtain higher representation capabilities. Empirical studies on four DGs that appear in communication networks show that the proposed STGCNDT significantly outperforms state-of-the-art models in solving link weight estimation tasks due to the diversified transformations."

        "abstract": "This study investigates different Scientific Machine Learning (SciML) approaches for the analysis of functionally graded (FG) porous beams and compares them under a new framework. The beam material properties are assumed to vary as an arbitrary continuous function. The methods consider the output of a neural network/operator as an approximation to the displacement fields and derive the equations governing beam behavior based on the continuum formulation. The methods are implemented in the framework and formulated by three approaches: (a) the vector approach leads to a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN), (b) the energy approach brings about the Deep Energy Method (DEM), and (c) the data-driven approach, which results in a class of Neural Operator methods. Finally, a neural operator has been trained to predict the response of the porous beam with functionally graded material under any porosity distribution pattern and any arbitrary traction condition. The results are validated with analytical and numerical reference solutions. The data and code accompanying this manuscript will be publicly available at this https URL."

However, it can be experimentally observed when deep layers are stacked, neural networks constructed with RePU encounter critical issues. These issues include the values exploding or vanishing and failure of training. And these happen regardless of the hyperparameter initialization.

        "abstract": "Continual Learning (CL) aims to enable Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn new data without forgetting previously learned knowledge. The key to achieving this goal is to avoid confusion at the feature level, i.e., avoiding confusion within old tasks and between new and old tasks. Previous prototype-based CL methods generate pseudo features for old knowledge replay by adding Gaussian noise to the centroids of old classes. However, the distribution in the feature space exhibits anisotropy during the incremental process, which prevents the pseudo features from faithfully reproducing the distribution of old knowledge in the feature space, leading to confusion in classification boundaries within old tasks. To address this issue, we propose the Distribution-Level Memory Recall (DMR) method, which uses a Gaussian mixture model to precisely fit the feature distribution of old knowledge at the distribution level and generate pseudo features in the next stage. Furthermore, resistance to confusion at the distribution level is also crucial for multimodal learning, as the problem of multimodal imbalance results in significant differences in feature responses between different modalities, exacerbating confusion within old tasks in prototype-based CL methods. Therefore, we mitigate the multi-modal imbalance problem by using the Inter-modal Guidance and Intra-modal Mining (IGIM) method to guide weaker modalities with prior information from dominant modalities and further explore useful information within modalities. For the second key, We propose the Confusion Index to quantitatively describe a model's ability to distinguish between new and old tasks, and we use the Incremental Mixup Feature Enhancement (IMFE) method to enhance pseudo features with new sample features, alleviating classification confusion between new and old knowledge."

        "abstract": "Sustainable energy is a crucial global challenge, and recent breakthroughs in nuclear fusion ignition underscore the potential of harnessing energy extracted from nuclear fusion in everyday life, thereby drawing significant attention to fusion ignition research, especially Laser-Plasma Interaction (LPI). Unfortunately, the complexity of LPI at ignition scale renders theory-based analysis nearly impossible -- instead, it has to rely heavily on Particle-in-Cell (PIC) simulations, which is extremely computationally intensive, making it a major bottleneck in advancing fusion ignition. In response, this work introduces Diff-PIC, a novel paradigm that leverages conditional diffusion models as a computationally efficient alternative to PIC simulations for generating high-fidelity scientific data. Specifically, we design a distillation paradigm to distill the physical patterns captured by PIC simulations into diffusion models, demonstrating both theoretical and practical feasibility. Moreover, to ensure practical effectiveness, we provide solutions for two critical challenges: (1) We develop a physically-informed conditional diffusion model that can learn and generate meaningful embeddings for mathematically continuous physical conditions. This model offers algorithmic generalization and adaptable transferability, effectively capturing the complex relationships between physical conditions and simulation outcomes; and (2) We employ the rectified flow technique to make our model a one-step conditional diffusion model, enhancing its efficiency further while maintaining high fidelity and physical validity. Diff-PIC establishes a new paradigm for using diffusion models to overcome the computational barriers in nuclear fusion research, setting a benchmark for future innovations and advancements in this field."

We used ResNet18, DenseNet121, and Xception as backbone architectures, integrating CBAM at different locations. Our dataset included 16 conditioning factors and 522 flash flood inventory points. Performance was evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC). Results showed that CBAM significantly improved model performance, with DenseNet121 incorporating CBAM in each convolutional block achieving the best results (accuracy = 0.95, AUC = 0.98). Distance to river and drainage density were identified as key factors.

However, existing augmentation methods, such as directly perturbing interaction graph (e.g., node/edge dropout), may interfere with the original connections and generate poor contrasting views, resulting in sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we define the views that share only a small amount of information with the original graph due to poor data augmentation as noisy views (i.e., the last 20% of the views with a cosine similarity value less than 0.1 to the original view). We demonstrate through detailed experiments that noisy views will significantly degrade recommendation performance. Further, we propose a model-agnostic Symmetric Graph Contrastive Learning (SGCL) method with theoretical guarantees to address this issue. Specifically, we introduce symmetry theory into graph contrastive learning, based on which we propose a symmetric form and contrast loss resistant to noisy interference. We provide theoretical proof that our proposed SGCL method has a high tolerance to noisy views. Further demonstration is given by conducting extensive experiments on three real-world datasets. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach substantially increases recommendation accuracy, with relative improvements reaching as high as 12.25% over nine other competing models. These results highlight the efficacy of our method."

Existing work either assumes all locations are equipped with sensors or focuses on short-term forecast. This paper studies partial sensing traffic forecast of long-term traffic, assuming sensors only at some locations. The study is important in lowering the infrastructure investment cost in traffic management since deploying sensors at all locations could incur prohibitively high cost. However, the problem is challenging due to the unknown distribution at unsensed locations, the intricate spatio-temporal correlation in long-term forecasting, as well as noise in data and irregularities in traffic patterns (e.g., road closure). We propose a Spatio-Temporal Partial Sensing (STPS) forecast model for long-term traffic prediction, with several novel contributions, including a rank-based embedding technique to capture irregularities and overcome noise, a spatial transfer matrix to overcome the spatial distribution shift from permanently sensed locations to unsensed locations, and a multi-step training process that utilizes all available data to successively refine the model parameters for better accuracy. Extensive experiments on several real-world traffic datasets demonstrate that STPS outperforms the state-of-the-art and achieves superior accuracy in partial sensing long-term forecasting."

First, we briefly recall key properties and peculiarities of some core neural network types, which we believe are the most relevant to photonics, also linking the layer's theoretical design to some photonics hardware realizations. After that, we elucidate the question of how to fine-tune the selected model's design to perform the required task with optimized accuracy. Then, in the review part, we discuss recent developments and progress for several selected applications of neural networks in photonics, including multiple aspects relevant to optical communications, imaging, sensing, and the design of new materials and lasers. In the following section, we put a special emphasis on how to accurately evaluate the complexity of neural networks in the context of the transition from algorithms to hardware implementation. The introduced complexity characteristics are used to analyze the applications of neural networks in optical communications, as a specific, albeit highly important example, comparing those with some benchmark signal processing methods. We combine the description of the well-known model compression strategies used in machine learning, with some novel techniques introduced recently in optical applications of neural networks.

We compare how these differences emerge and apply a range of existing bias mitigation methods to each one. A key insight is that each disparity has unique properties and responds differently to the mitigation methods. We also find that these methods are largely unable to enhance fairness, highlighting the need for better bias mitigation methods tailored to the specific type of bias."

Here we focus on hedges in an experimentally parameterized corpus of 63 Roadrunner cartoon narratives spontaneously produced from memory by 21 speakers for co-present addressees, transcribed to text (Galati and Brennan, 2010). We created a gold standard of hedges annotated by human coders (the Roadrunner-Hedge corpus) and compared three LLM-based approaches for hedge detection: fine-tuning BERT, and zero and few-shot prompting with GPT-4o and LLaMA-3. The best-performing approach was a fine-tuned BERT model, followed by few-shot GPT-4o. After an error analysis on the top performing approaches, we used an LLM-in-the-Loop approach to improve the gold standard coding, as well as to highlight cases in which hedges are ambiguous in linguistically interesting ways that will guide future research.

However, in the process of integrating external non-parametric supporting evidence with internal parametric knowledge, inevitable knowledge conflicts may arise, leading to confusion in the model's responses. To enhance the knowledge selection of LLMs in various contexts, some research has focused on refining their behavior patterns through instruction-tuning. Nonetheless, due to the absence of explicit negative signals and comparative objectives, models fine-tuned in this manner may still exhibit undesirable behaviors in the intricate and realistic retrieval scenarios. To this end, we propose a Knowledge-aware Preference Optimization, dubbed KaPO, aimed at achieving controllable knowledge selection in real retrieval scenarios. Concretely, we explore and simulate error types across diverse context combinations and learn how to avoid these negative signals through preference optimization methods. Simultaneously, by adjusting the balance between response length and the proportion of preference data representing different behavior patterns, we enhance the adherence capabilities and noise robustness of LLMs in a balanced manner. Experimental results show that KaPO outperforms previous methods for handling knowledge conflicts by over 37%, while also exhibiting robust generalization across various out-of-distribution datasets."

By manually manipulating the recall process of parametric knowledge in LLMs, we demonstrate that enhancing this recall process directly improves reasoning performance whereas suppressing it leads to notable degradation. Furthermore, we assess the effect of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, a powerful technique for addressing complex reasoning tasks. Our findings indicate that CoT can intensify the recall of factual knowledge by encouraging LLMs to engage in orderly and reliable reasoning.

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLM)'s are increasingly used for topic modeling outperforming classical topic models such as LDA. Commonly, pre-trained LLM encoders such as BERT are used out-of-the-box despite the fact that fine-tuning is known to improve LLMs considerably. The challenge lies in obtaining a suitable (labeled) dataset for fine-tuning. In this paper, we use the recent idea to use bag of sentences as the elementary unit in computing topics. In turn, we derive an approach FT-Topic to perform unsupervised fine-tuning relying primarily on two steps for constructing a training dataset in an automatic fashion. First, a heuristic method to identifies pairs of sentence groups that are either assumed to be of the same or different topics. Second, we remove sentence pairs that are likely labeled incorrectly. The dataset is then used to fine-tune an encoder LLM, which can be leveraged by any topic modeling approach using embeddings. However, in this work, we demonstrate its effectiveness by deriving a novel state-of-the-art topic modeling method called SenClu, which achieves fast inference through an expectation-maximization algorithm and hard assignments of sentence groups to a single topic, while giving users the possibility to encode prior knowledge on the topic-document distribution.

        "abstract": "Prompt compression is crucial for enhancing inference speed, reducing costs, and improving user experience. However, current methods face challenges such as low compression ratios and potential data leakage during evaluation. To address these issues, we propose 500xCompressor, a method that compresses extensive natural language contexts into a minimum of one single special token. The 500xCompressor introduces approximately 0.3% additional parameters and achieves compression ratios ranging from 6x to 480x. It is designed to compress any text, answer various types of questions, and could be utilized by the original large language model (LLM) without requiring fine-tuning. Initially, 500xCompressor was pretrained on the Arxiv Corpus, followed by fine-tuning on the ArxivQA dataset, and subsequently evaluated on strictly unseen and classical question answering (QA) datasets. The results demonstrate that the LLM retained 62.26-72.89% of its capabilities compared to using non-compressed prompts. This study also shows that not all the compressed tokens are equally utilized and that K V values have significant advantages over embeddings in preserving information at high compression ratios. The highly compressive nature of natural language prompts, even for fine-grained complex information, suggests promising potential for future applications and further research into developing a new LLM language."

        "abstract": "Merging Large Language Models (LLMs) aims to amalgamate multiple homologous LLMs into one with all the capabilities. Ideally, any LLMs sharing the same backbone should be mergeable, irrespective of whether they are Fine-Tuned (FT) with minor parameter changes or Pre-Trained (PT) with substantial parameter shifts. However, existing methods often manually assign the model importance, rendering them feasible only for LLMs with similar parameter alterations, such as multiple FT LLMs. The diverse parameter changed ranges between FT and PT LLMs pose challenges for current solutions in empirically determining the optimal combination. In this paper, we make a pioneering effort to broaden the applicability of merging techniques from FT to PT LLMs. We initially examine the efficacy of current methods in merging FT and PT LLMs, discovering that they struggle to deal with PT LLMs. Subsequently, we introduce an approach based on WeIght DisENtanglement (WIDEN) to effectively extend the merging scope, which first disentangles model weights into magnitude and direction components, and then performs adaptive fusion by considering their respective contributions. In the experiments, we merge Qwen1.5-Chat (an FT LLM with instruction-following skills) with Sailor (a PT LLM with multilingual abilities) across 7B and 14B model scales. Results reveal that: (1) existing solutions usually fail when merging Sailor, either losing both abilities or only retaining instruction-following skills; (2) WIDEN successfully injects the multilingual abilities of Sailor into Qwen1.5-Chat and make it proficient in Southeast Asian languages, achieving enhancements in the fundamental capabilities. In light of previous research, we also merge multiple 13B FT LLMs and observe that WIDEN achieves a balanced amalgamation of instruction following, mathematical reasoning, and code generation skills."

Despite ChatGPT's recent success, fine-tuning small models remains the best approach for the ECE task. However, existing fine-tuning based ECE methods cannot address all three key challenges in ECE simultaneously: 1) Complex Causality Extraction, where multiple causal-effect pairs occur within a single sentence; 2) Subtask~ Interaction, which involves modeling the mutual dependence between the two subtasks of ECE, i.e., extracting events and identifying the causal relationship between extracted events; and 3) Knowledge Fusion, which requires effectively fusing the knowledge in two modalities, i.e., the expressive pretrained language models and the structured knowledge graphs. In this paper, we propose a unified ECE framework (UniCE to address all three issues in ECE simultaneously. Specifically, we design a subtask interaction mechanism to enable mutual interaction between the two ECE subtasks. Besides, we design a knowledge fusion mechanism to fuse knowledge in the two modalities. Furthermore, we employ separate decoders for each subtask to facilitate complex causality extraction. Experiments on three benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance and outperforms ChatGPT with a margin of at least 30% F1-score.

In this paper we focus rather on the way PLMs encode negation and its formal impact, through the phenomenon of the Negative Polarity Item (NPI) licensing in English. More precisely, we use probes to identify which contextual representations best encode 1) the presence of negation in a sentence, and 2) the polarity of a neighboring masked polarity item. We find that contextual representations of tokens inside the negation scope do allow for (i) a better prediction of the presence of not compared to those outside the scope and (ii) a better prediction of the right polarity of a masked polarity item licensed by not, although the magnitude of the difference varies from PLM to PLM. Importantly, in both cases the trend holds even when controlling for distance to not. This tends to indicate that the embeddings of these models do reflect the notion of negation scope, and do encode the impact of negation on NPI licensing. Yet, further control experiments reveal that the presence of other lexical items is also better captured when using the contextual representation of a token within the same syntactic clause than outside from it, suggesting that PLMs simply capture the more general notion of syntactic clause."

In this study, we explore the representation and processing of Argument Structure Constructions (ASCs) in a recurrent neural language model. We trained a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network on a custom-made dataset consisting of 2000 sentences, generated using GPT-4, representing four distinct ASCs: transitive, ditransitive, caused-motion, and resultative constructions.\nWe analyzed the internal activations of the LSTM model's hidden layers using Multidimensional Scaling (MDS) and t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) to visualize the sentence representations. The Generalized Discrimination Value (GDV) was calculated to quantify the degree of clustering within these representations. Our results show that sentence representations form distinct clusters corresponding to the four ASCs across all hidden layers, with the most pronounced clustering observed in the last hidden layer before the output layer. This indicates that even a relatively simple, brain-constrained recurrent neural network can effectively differentiate between various construction types.\nThese findings are consistent with previous studies demonstrating the emergence of word class and syntax rule representations in recurrent language models trained on next word prediction tasks. In future work, we aim to validate these results using larger language models and compare them with neuroimaging data obtained during continuous speech perception. This study highlights the potential of recurrent neural language models to mirror linguistic processing in the human brain, providing valuable insights into the computational and neural mechanisms underlying language understanding."

Previous methods mainly focus on using maximum likelihood estimation as the optimization objective for training response generation models, without taking into account the empathy level alignment between generated responses and target responses. To this end, we propose an empathetic response generation using reinforcement learning (EmpRL) framework. The framework designs an effective empathy reward function and generates empathetic responses by maximizing the expected reward through reinforcement learning. Given the powerful text generation capability of pre-trained language models, EmpRL utilizes the pre-trained T5 model as the generator and conducts further training to initialize the policy. To align the empathy level between generated responses and target responses in the context, an empathy reward function containing three empathy communication mechanisms, i.e., emotional reaction, interpretation, and exploration, is constructed using pre-designed and pre-trained empathy identifiers. Finally, the proximal policy optimization algorithm is used to further train the policy to produce empathetic responses. Both automatic and manual evaluations demonstrate that the proposed EmpRL framework can improve the quality of generated responses, enhance the empathy level similarity between generated and target responses, and produce empathetic responses covering both affective and cognitive aspects."

Although state-of-the-art LLMs have shown superior performance in several conversational applications, evaluations within nutrition and diet applications are still insufficient. In this paper, we propose to employ the Registered Dietitian (RD) exam to conduct a standard and comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and Gemini 1.5 Pro, assessing both accuracy and consistency in nutrition queries. Our evaluation includes 1050 RD exam questions encompassing several nutrition topics and proficiency levels. In addition, for the first time, we examine the impact of Zero-Shot (ZS), Chain of Thought (CoT), Chain of Thought with Self Consistency (CoT-SC), and Retrieval Augmented Prompting (RAP) on both accuracy and consistency of the responses. Our findings revealed that while these LLMs obtained acceptable overall performance, their results varied considerably with different prompts and question domains. GPT-4o with CoT-SC prompting outperformed the other approaches, whereas Gemini 1.5 Pro with ZS recorded the highest consistency. For GPT-4o and Claude 3.5, CoT improved the accuracy, and CoT-SC improved both accuracy and consistency. RAP was particularly effective for GPT-4o to answer Expert level questions. Consequently, choosing the appropriate LLM and prompting technique, tailored to the proficiency level and specific domain, can mitigate errors and potential risks in diet and nutrition chatbots."

This fact is taken to suggest that yellowness is somehow a typical feature of bananas, and blueness is exceptional. Similar to how a yellow color is typical of bananas, there may also be genders that are typical of occupations. In this work, we explore this question using information theoretic techniques coupled with corpus statistic analysis. In two distinct large corpora, we do not find strong evidence that occupations and gender display the same patterns of mentioning as do bananas and color. Instead, we find that gender mentioning is correlated with femaleness of occupation in particular, suggesting perhaps that woman-dominated occupations are seen as somehow ``more gendered'' than male-dominated ones, and thereby they encourage more gender mentioning overall."

In our intermediate DPO approach, DPO losses are calculated using the logits from K-selected intermediate layers and averaged to obtain the intermediate DPO loss.

During inference, the intermediate DPO model decodes using the final layer logits similarly to the conventional DPO model. In experiments using the ultrafeedback dataset, the performance of the intermediate DPO model was evaluated using GPT-4. As a result, the intermediate DPO model trained using the intermediate DPO loss calculated at the 22nd layer of a 32-layer SFT model achieved win rates of 52.5% and 67.5% against the conventional DPO and SFT models, respectively, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method.

In this work, we take a more principled approach to unit-testing datasets by proposing a taxonomy based on the V-information literature. We call a collection of such unit tests a data checklist. Using a checklist, not only are we able to recover known artifacts in well-known datasets such as SNLI, but we also discover previously unknown artifacts in preference datasets for LLM alignment.

Additionally, we design a graph-based evidence chain retriever that utilizes previous paths and chunk interactions to guide the retrieval process. It identifies multiple seed nodes based on the target question and iteratively searches for relevant chunks to gather supporting evidence. This retrieval process refines the context and reasoning chain, aiding the large language model in reasoning and answer generation.

Understanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support human decision-making. We propose utility theory-a paradigm at the core of modern economic theory-as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs. Utility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior against benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To demonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a variety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We also find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic behavior across settings.

In this paper, we study the scaling of inference-time computation in LLMs, with a focus on answering the question: if an LLM is allowed to use a fixed but non-trivial amount of inference-time compute, how much can it improve its performance on a challenging prompt? Answering this question has implications not only on the achievable performance of LLMs, but also on the future of LLM pretraining and how one should tradeoff inference-time and pre-training compute. Despite its importance, little research attempted to understand the scaling behaviors of various test-time inference methods. Moreover, current work largely provides negative results for a number of these strategies. In this work, we analyze two primary mechanisms to scale test-time computation: (1) searching against dense, process-based verifier reward models; and (2) updating the model's distribution over a response adaptively, given the prompt at test time. We find that in both cases, the effectiveness of different approaches to scaling test-time compute critically varies depending on the difficulty of the prompt. This observation motivates applying a \"compute-optimal\" scaling strategy, which acts to most effectively allocate test-time compute adaptively per prompt. Using this compute-optimal strategy, we can improve the efficiency of test-time compute scaling by more than 4x compared to a best-of-N baseline. Additionally, in a FLOPs-matched evaluation, we find that on problems where a smaller base model attains somewhat non-trivial success rates, test-time compute can be used to outperform a 14x larger model."

In this work, we first analyze the relationship between the performance of different layers and their ranks using SVD. Based on this, we design the Singular-Value Based Adaptive Low-Rank Adaption(SARA), which adaptively finds the rank during initialization by performing SVD on the pre-trained weights. Additionally, we explore the Mixture-of-SARA(Mo-SARA), which significantly reduces the number of parameters by fine-tuning only multiple parallel sets of singular values controlled by a router.

        "abstract": "Data serves as the fundamental foundation for advancing deep learning, particularly tabular data presented in a structured format, which is highly conducive to modeling. However, even in the era of LLM, obtaining tabular data from sensitive domains remains a challenge due to privacy or copyright concerns. Hence, exploring how to effectively use models like LLMs to generate realistic and privacy-preserving synthetic tabular data is urgent. In this paper, we take a step forward to explore LLMs for tabular data synthesis and privacy protection, by introducing a new framework HARMONIC for tabular data generation and evaluation. In the tabular data generation of our framework, unlike previous small-scale LLM-based methods that rely on continued pre-training, we explore the larger-scale LLMs with fine-tuning to generate tabular data and enhance privacy. Based on idea of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm, an instruction fine-tuning dataset is constructed to inspire LLMs to discover inter-row relationships. Then, with fine-tuning, LLMs are trained to remember the format and connections of the data rather than the data itself, which reduces the risk of privacy leakage. In the evaluation part of our framework, we develop specific privacy risk metrics DLT for LLM synthetic data generation, as well as performance evaluation metrics LLE for downstream LLM tasks. Our experiments find that this tabular data generation framework achieves equivalent performance to existing methods with better privacy, which also demonstrates our evaluation framework for the effectiveness of synthetic data and privacy risks in LLM scenarios."

This is because no unified training and evaluation codebase covers multiple settings. The second is user-unfriendly design. Because previous works use different libraries, researchers set up individual environments. In addition, most works release only the training codes, requiring users to implement the whole inference process of MR-HD. Lighthouse addresses these issues by implementing a unified reproducible codebase that includes six models, three features, and five datasets. In addition, it provides an inference API and web demo to make these methods easily accessible for researchers and developers. Our experiments demonstrate that Lighthouse generally reproduces the reported scores in the reference papers. The code is available at this https URL."

The output of the intent detection module strongly conditions the behavior of the whole system. This sequence analysis task is mainly tackled using deep learning techniques. Despite the widespread use of these techniques, the internal mechanisms used by networks to solve the problem are poorly understood. Recent lines of work have analyzed the computational mechanisms learned by RNNs from a dynamical systems perspective. In this work, we investigate how different RNN architectures solve the SNIPS intent detection problem. Sentences injected into trained networks can be interpreted as trajectories traversing a hidden state space. This space is constrained to a low-dimensional manifold whose dimensionality is related to the embedding and hidden layer sizes. To generate predictions, RNN steers the trajectories towards concrete regions, spatially aligned with the output layer matrix rows directions. Underlying the system dynamics, an unexpected fixed point topology has been identified with a limited number of attractors. Our results provide new insights into the inner workings of networks that solve the intent detection task."

However, the effectiveness of the Transformer architecture in the domain of co-speech gesture generation remains relatively unexplored, as prior methodologies have predominantly employed the Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) or simple a few transformer layers. In an attempt to bridge this research gap, we introduce a novel Masked Diffusion Transformer for co-speech gesture generation, referred to as MDT-A2G, which directly implements the denoising process on gesture sequences. To enhance the contextual reasoning capability of temporally aligned speech-driven gestures, we incorporate a novel Masked Diffusion Transformer. This model employs a mask modeling scheme specifically designed to strengthen temporal relation learning among sequence gestures, thereby expediting the learning process and leading to coherent and realistic motions. Apart from audio, Our MDT-A2G model also integrates multi-modal information, encompassing text, emotion, and identity. Furthermore, we propose an efficient inference strategy that diminishes the denoising computation by leveraging previously calculated results, thereby achieving a speedup with negligible performance degradation. Experimental results demonstrate that MDT-A2G excels in gesture generation, boasting a learning speed that is over 6$\\times$ faster than traditional diffusion transformers and an inference speed that is 5.7$\\times$ than the standard diffusion model."

While achieving quantitative performance akin to an expert annotator, some results still lack qualitative precision and, thus, require annotators for inspection and potential correction, maintaining resource intensity. In response, we propose a deep neural network trained to interactively refine existing annotations based on human guidance. Our human-in-the-loop approach streamlines annotation, achieving equal quality with up to 75% less manual input required. Moreover, during the refinement process, the relative improvement of our methodology over pure manual labeling reaches peak values of up to 26%, attaining drastically better quality quicker.

Existing methods often overlook the critical roles of interactive body parts and fail to adequately capture and align part-level semantics, resulting in inaccuracies and even erroneous movement outcomes. To address these issues, TextIM utilizes a decoupled conditional diffusion framework to enhance the detailed alignment between interactive movements and corresponding semantic intents from textual descriptions. Our approach leverages large language models, functioning as a human brain, to identify interacting human body parts and to comprehend interaction semantics to generate complicated and subtle interactive motion. Guided by the refined movements of the interacting parts, TextIM further extends these movements into a coherent whole-body motion. We design a spatial coherence module to complement the entire body movements while maintaining consistency and harmony across body parts using a part graph convolutional network. For training and evaluation, we carefully selected and re-labeled interactive motions from HUMANML3D to develop a specialized dataset.

Post-training quantization (PTQ), a promising method for model compression, still faces accuracy degradation challenges with ViTs. There are two reasons for this: the existing quantization paradigm does not fit the power-law distribution of post-Softmax activations well, and accuracy inevitably decreases after reparameterizing post-LayerNorm activations. We propose a Distribution-Friendly and Outlier-Aware Post-training Quantization method for Vision Transformers, named DopQ-ViT. DopQ-ViT analyzes the inefficiencies of current quantizers and introduces a distribution-friendly Tan Quantizer called TanQ. TanQ focuses more on values near 1, more accurately preserving the power-law distribution of post-Softmax activations, and achieves favorable results. Moreover, when reparameterizing post-LayerNorm activations from channel-wise to layer-wise quantization, the accuracy degradation is mainly due to the significant impact of outliers in the scaling factors. Therefore, DopQ-ViT proposes a method to Search for the Optimal Scaling Factor, denoted as SOSF, which compensates for the influence of outliers and preserves the performance of the quantization model. DopQ-ViT has undergone extensive validation and demonstrates significant performance improvements in quantization models, particularly in low-bit settings."

The key design is revisiting and rewiring the Style-based generator to efficiently adopt 3D facial dynamics predicted by a principled style-injected Transformer. By simply re-configuring the information insertion mechanisms within the noise and style space, our framework fuses motion and appearance with unified training. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ReSyncer not only produces high-fidelity lip-synced videos according to audio, but also supports multiple appealing properties that are suitable for creating virtual presenters and performers, including fast personalized fine-tuning, video-driven lip-syncing, the transfer of speaking styles, and even face swapping.

Departing from the prevalent focus on performance enhancements, this work prioritizes the crucial trade-off between performance and memory requirements. The proposed model uses a transformer-based architecture designed to estimate image-to-image similarity by capturing interactions within and across images based on their local descriptors. A distinctive property of the model is the capability for asymmetric similarity estimation. Database images are represented with a smaller number of descriptors compared to query images, enabling performance improvements without increasing memory consumption. To ensure adaptability across different applications, a universal model is introduced that adjusts to a varying number of local descriptors during the testing phase. Results on standard benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach over both hand-crafted and learned models. In particular, compared with current state-of-the-art methods that overlook their memory footprint, our approach not only attains superior performance but does so with a significantly reduced memory footprint.

Event cameras possess remarkable attributes such as high dynamic range, low latency, and resilience against motion blur, which enables them to address challenging high dynamic range scenes or high-speed motion. These features make event cameras an ideal complement over standard cameras for object pose estimation. In this work, we propose a line-based robust pose estimation and tracking method for planar or non-planar objects using an event camera. Firstly, we extract object lines directly from events, then provide an initial pose using a globally-optimal Branch-and-Bound approach, where 2D-3D line correspondences are not known in advance. Subsequently, we utilize event-line matching to establish correspondences between 2D events and 3D models. Furthermore, object poses are refined and continuously tracked by minimizing event-line distances. Events are assigned different weights based on these distances, employing robust estimation algorithms. To evaluate the precision of the proposed methods in object pose estimation and tracking, we have devised and established an event-based moving object dataset. Compared against state-of-the-art methods, the robustness and accuracy of our methods have been validated both on synthetic experiments and the proposed dataset.

It enables multiple clinical sites to collaboratively train a series of models in privacy, with each model tailored to the individual distribution of each site. Existing PFL methods rarely consider the personalization of multi-headed self-attention, and do not account for appearance diversity and instrument shape similarity, both inherent in surgical scenes. We thus propose PFedSIS, a novel PFL method with visual trait priors for SIS, incorporating global-personalized disentanglement (GPD), appearance-regulation personalized enhancement (APE), and shape-similarity global enhancement (SGE), to boost SIS performance in each site. GPD represents the first attempt at head-wise assignment for multi-headed self-attention personalization. To preserve the unique appearance representation of each site and gradually leverage the inter-site difference, APE introduces appearance regulation and provides customized layer-wise aggregation solutions via hypernetworks for each site's personalized parameters. The mutual shape information of instruments is maintained and shared via SGE, which enhances the cross-style shape consistency on the image level and computes the shape-similarity contribution of each site on the prediction level for updating the global parameters.

We identify the backward pass on the stochastic samples as the computational bottleneck during the optimization. We thus perform the first forward pass in inference mode as a relatively low-cost search for hard samples. This is followed by building the computational graph and updating the NeRF network parameters using only the hard samples. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach, we apply our method to Instant-NGP, resulting in significant improvements of the view-synthesis quality over the baseline (1 dB improvement on average per training time, or 2x speedup to reach the same PSNR level) along with approx. 40% memory savings coming from using only the hard samples to build the computational graph.

Here, we show that, in addition, DCLS increases the models' interpretability, defined as the alignment with human visual strategies. To quantify it, we use the Spearman correlation between the models' GradCAM heatmaps and the ClickMe dataset heatmaps, which reflect human visual attention. We took eight reference models - ResNet50, ConvNeXt (T, S and B), CAFormer, ConvFormer, and FastViT (sa 24 and 36) - and drop-in replaced the standard convolution layers with DCLS ones. This improved the interpretability score in seven of them.

To evaluate the first two capabilities, grounding visual history and forecasting in short and long horizons, we conduct benchmarking of two prominent classes of multimodal LLM approaches -- Socratic Models and Vision Conditioned Language Models (VCLMs) on video-based action anticipation tasks using offline datasets. These offline benchmarks, however, do not allow us to close the loop with the user, which is essential to evaluate the replanning capabilities and measure successful activity completion in assistive scenarios. To that end, we conduct a first-of-its-kind user study, with 18 participants performing 3 different multi-step cooking activities while wearing an egocentric observation device called Aria and following assistance from multimodal LLMs. We find that the Socratic approach outperforms VCLMs in both offline and online settings.

In particular, the diffusion model, a core component of recent generative AI, produces high-quality images with rich diversity. In this study, we propose a novel CT reconstruction method by combining the denoising diffusion probabilistic model with iterative CT reconstruction. In sharp contrast to previous studies, we optimize the fidelity loss of CT reconstruction with respect to the latent variable of the diffusion model, instead of the image and model parameters. To suppress anatomical structure changes produced by the diffusion model, we shallow the diffusion and reverse processes, and fix a set of added noises in the reverse process to make it deterministic during inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through sparse view CT reconstruction of 1/10 view projection data. Despite the simplicity of the implementation, the proposed method shows the capability of reconstructing high-quality images while preserving the patient's anatomical structure, and outperforms existing methods including iterative reconstruction, iterative reconstruction with total variation, and the diffusion model alone in terms of quantitative indices such as SSIM and PSNR. We also explore further sparse view CT using 1/20 view projection data with the same trained diffusion model. As the number of iterations increases, image quality improvement comparable to that of 1/10 sparse view CT reconstruction is achieved. In principle, the proposed method can be widely applied not only to CT but also to other imaging modalities such as MRI, PET, and SPECT."

Current approaches frequently fail to fulfil the extensive demands of these industries, which encompass high performance, consistency, and fast operation, along with the capacity to leverage the entirety of the available training data. Addressing these gaps, we introduce SuperSimpleNet, an innovative discriminative model that evolved from SimpleNet. This advanced model significantly enhances its predecessor's training consistency, inference time, as well as detection performance. SuperSimpleNet operates in an unsupervised manner using only normal training images but also benefits from labelled abnormal training images when they are available.

        "abstract": "Existing plant disease classification models have achieved remarkable performance in recognizing in-laboratory diseased images. However, their performance often significantly degrades in classifying in-the-wild images. Furthermore, we observed that in-the-wild plant images may exhibit similar appearances across various diseases (i.e., small inter-class discrepancy) while the same diseases may look quite different (i.e., large intra-class variance). Motivated by this observation, we propose an in-the-wild multimodal plant disease recognition dataset that contains the largest number of disease classes but also text-based descriptions for each disease. Particularly, the newly provided text descriptions are introduced to provide rich information in textual modality and facilitate in-the-wild disease classification with small inter-class discrepancy and large intra-class variance issues. Therefore, our proposed dataset can be regarded as an ideal testbed for evaluating disease recognition methods in the real world. In addition, we further present a strong yet versatile baseline that models text descriptions and visual data through multiple prototypes for a given class. By fusing the contributions of multimodal prototypes in classification, our baseline can effectively address the small inter-class discrepancy and large intra-class variance issues. Remarkably, our baseline model can not only classify diseases but also recognize diseases in few-shot or training-free scenarios. Extensive benchmarking results demonstrate that our proposed in-the-wild multimodal dataset sets many new challenges to the plant disease recognition task and there is a large space to improve for future works."

While Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) has emerged as a promising solution to address these limitations, its implementation in endoscopic procedures presents significant challenges due to hardware limitations, such as the use of a monocular camera and the absence of odometry sensors. This study presents a robust deep learning-based SLAM approach that combines state-of-the-art and newly developed models. It consists of three main parts: the Monocular Pose Estimation Module that introduces a novel unsupervised method based on the CycleGAN architecture, the Monocular Depth Estimation Module that leverages the novel Zoe architecture, and the 3D Reconstruction Module which uses information from the previous models to create a coherent surgical map. The performance of the procedure was rigorously evaluated using three publicly available datasets (Hamlyn, EndoSLAM, and SCARED) and benchmarked against two state-of-the-art methods, EndoSFMLearner and EndoDepth. The integration of Zoe in the MDEM demonstrated superior performance compared to state-of-the-art depth estimation algorithms in endoscopy, whereas the novel approach in the MPEM exhibited competitive performance and the lowest inference time. The results showcase the robustness of our approach in laparoscopy, gastroscopy, and colonoscopy, three different scenarios in endoscopic surgery. The proposed SLAM approach has the potential to improve the accuracy and efficiency of endoscopic procedures by providing surgeons with enhanced depth perception and 3D reconstruction capabilities."

However, most gaussian fields-based methods are trained with all image pixels, encompassing building and nonbuilding areas, which results in a significant noise for building meshes and degeneration in time efficiency. This paper proposes a novel framework, Masked Gaussian Fields (MGFs), designed to generate accurate surface reconstruction for building in a time-efficient way. The framework first applies EfficientSAM and COLMAP to generate multi-level masks of building and the corresponding masked point clouds. Subsequently, the masked gaussian fields are trained by integrating two innovative losses: a multi-level perceptual masked loss focused on constructing building regions and a boundary loss aimed at enhancing the details of the boundaries between different masks. Finally, we improve the tetrahedral surface mesh extraction method based on the masked gaussian spheres. Comprehensive experiments on UAV images demonstrate that, compared to the traditional method and several NeRF-based and Gaussian-based SOTA solutions, our approach significantly improves both the accuracy and efficiency of building surface reconstruction. Notably, as a byproduct, there is an additional gain in the novel view synthesis of building."

This study addresses the issue of suboptimal single-spectral nighttime pedestrian detection performance under low-light conditions by incorporating background information into the channel attention mechanism. Despite numerous studies focusing on the development of efficient channel attention mechanisms, the relevance of background information has been largely disregarded. By adopting a contrast learning approach, we reexamine channel attention with regard to pedestrian objects and background information for nighttime pedestrian detection, resulting in the proposed Fore-Background Contrast Attention (FBCA). FBCA possesses two primary attributes: (1) channel descriptors form remote dependencies with global spatial feature information; (2) the integration of background information enhances the distinction between channels concentrating on low-light pedestrian features and those focusing on background information. Consequently, the acquired channel descriptors exhibit a higher semantic level and spatial accuracy. Experimental outcomes demonstrate that FBCA significantly outperforms existing methods in single-spectral nighttime pedestrian detection, achieving state-of-the-art results on the NightOwls and TJU-DHD-pedestrian datasets. Furthermore, this methodology also yields performance improvements for the multispectral LLVIP dataset. These findings indicate that integrating background information into the channel attention mechanism effectively mitigates detector performance degradation caused by illumination factors in nighttime scenarios."

The task aims to detect abnormal events in test video using unlabeled videos as training data. The presence of anomalies in the training data poses a significant challenge in this task, particularly because they form clusters in the feature space. We refer to this property as the \"Anomaly Cluster\" issue. The condensed nature of these anomalies makes it difficult to distinguish between normal and abnormal data in the training set. Consequently, training conventional anomaly detection techniques using an unlabeled dataset often leads to sub-optimal results. To tackle this difficulty, we propose a new method called Cleansed k-Nearest Neighbor (CKNN), which explicitly filters out the Anomaly Clusters by cleansing the training dataset. Following the k-nearest neighbor algorithm in the feature space provides powerful anomaly detection capability. Although the identified Anomaly Cluster issue presents a significant challenge to applying k-nearest neighbor in UVAD, our proposed cleansing scheme effectively addresses this problem. We evaluate the proposed method on various benchmark datasets and demonstrate that CKNN outperforms the previous state-of-the-art UVAD method by up to 8.5% (from 82.0 to 89.0) in terms of AUROC. Moreover, we emphasize that the performance of the proposed method is comparable to that of the state-of-the-art method trained using anomaly-free data."

The essential of the EVC task is to effectively perceive subtle and ambiguous visual emotional cues during the caption generation, which is neglected by the traditional video captioning. Existing emotional video captioning methods perceive global visual emotional cues at first, and then combine them with the video features to guide the emotional caption generation, which neglects two characteristics of the EVC task. Firstly, their methods neglect the dynamic subtle changes in the intrinsic emotions of the video, which makes it difficult to meet the needs of common scenes with diverse and changeable emotions. Secondly, as their methods incorporate emotional cues into each step, the guidance role of emotion is overemphasized, which makes factual content more or less ignored during generation. To this end, we propose a dual-path collaborative generation network, which dynamically perceives visual emotional cues evolutions while generating emotional captions by collaborative learning. Specifically, in the dynamic emotion perception path, we propose a dynamic emotion evolution module, which first aggregates visual features and historical caption features to summarize the global visual emotional cues, and then dynamically selects emotional cues required to be re-composed at each stage. Besides, in the adaptive caption generation path, to balance the description of factual content and emotional cues, we propose an emotion adaptive decoder. Thus, our methods can generate emotion-related words at the necessary time step, and our caption generation balances the guidance of factual content and emotional cues well. Extensive experiments on three challenging datasets demonstrate the superiority of our approach and each proposed module."

Investigating multimodal systems' robustness via adversarial attacks is crucial in this field. Most multimodal attacks are sample-specific, generating a unique perturbation for each sample to construct adversarial samples. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first work through multimodal decision boundaries to explore the creation of a universal, sample-agnostic perturbation that applies to any image. Initially, we explore strategies to move sample points beyond the decision boundaries of linear classifiers, refining the algorithm to ensure successful attacks under the top $k$ accuracy metric. Based on this foundation, in visual-language tasks, we treat visual and textual modalities as reciprocal sample points and decision hyperplanes, guiding image embeddings to traverse text-constructed decision boundaries, and vice versa. This iterative process consistently refines a universal perturbation, ultimately identifying a singular direction within the input space which is exploitable to impair the retrieval performance of VLP models. The proposed algorithms support the creation of global perturbations or adversarial patches.

Many researchers resort to voxelization to introduce regularity, but this approach suffers from quantization loss. In this research, we use the KNN method to determine the neighborhoods of raw surface points. This gives us a means to determine the spatial context in which the latent features of 3D points are compressed by arithmetic coding. As such, the conditional probability model is adaptive to local geometry, leading to significant rate reduction. Additionally, we propose a dual-layer architecture where a non-learning base layer reconstructs the main structures of the point cloud at low complexity, while a learned refinement layer focuses on preserving fine details. This design leads to reductions in model complexity and coding latency by two orders of magnitude compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR) into the refinement layer, allowing the decoder to sample points on the underlying surface at arbitrary densities. This work is the first to effectively exploit content-aware local contexts for compressing irregular raw point clouds, achieving high rate-distortion performance, low complexity, and the ability to function as an arbitrary-scale upsampling network simultaneously."

        "abstract": "This paper introduces MedTrinity-25M, a comprehensive, large-scale multimodal dataset for medicine, covering over 25 million images across 10 modalities, with multigranular annotations for more than 65 diseases. These enriched annotations encompass both global textual information, such as disease/lesion type, modality, region-specific descriptions, and inter-regional relationships, as well as detailed local annotations for regions of interest (ROIs), including bounding boxes, segmentation masks. Unlike existing approach which is limited by the availability of image-text pairs, we have developed the first automated pipeline that scales up multimodal data by generating multigranular visual and texual annotations (in the form of image-ROI-description triplets) without the need for any paired text descriptions. Specifically, data from over 90 different sources have been collected, preprocessed, and grounded using domain-specific expert models to identify ROIs related to abnormal regions. We then build a comprehensive knowledge base and prompt multimodal large language models to perform retrieval-augmented generation with the identified ROIs as guidance, resulting in multigranular texual descriptions. Compared to existing datasets, MedTrinity-25M provides the most enriched annotations, supporting a comprehensive range of multimodal tasks such as captioning and report generation, as well as vision-centric tasks like classification and segmentation. Pretraining on MedTrinity-25M, our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on VQA-RAD and PathVQA, surpassing both multimodal large language models and other representative SoTA approaches. This dataset can also be utilized to support large-scale pre-training of multimodal medical AI models, contributing to the development of future foundation models in the medical domain."

In practice, ECG data is stored as either digitized signals or printed images. Despite the emergence of numerous deep learning models for digitized signals, many hospitals prefer image storage due to cost considerations. Recognizing the unavailability of raw ECG signals in many clinical settings, we propose VizECGNet, which uses only printed ECG graphics to determine the prognosis of multiple cardiovascular diseases. During training, cross-modal attention modules (CMAM) are used to integrate information from two modalities - image and signal, while self-modality attention modules (SMAM) capture inherent long-range dependencies in ECG data of each modality. Additionally, we utilize knowledge distillation to improve the similarity between two distinct predictions from each modality stream. This innovative multi-modal deep learning architecture enables the utilization of only ECG images during inference. VizECGNet with image input achieves higher performance in precision, recall, and F1-Score compared to signal-based ECG classification models, with improvements of 3.50%, 8.21%, and 7.38%, respectively."

A relatively complete humanoid agent first needs to have face and body, then possess both verbal and non-verbal (such as eye contact, facial expression, lip motion, gesture, and manipulation) abilities, and finally, it is capable of real-time duplex communication, e.g., the ability to actively interrupt conversations. Most prior systems typically only consider a subset of these elements, leaving a gap from realistic humanoid agent. In this work, we propose a real-time, duplex, interactive end-to-end network capable of modeling realistic agent behaviors, including speech, full-body movements for talking, responding, idling, and manipulation. This system is a multimodal model integrating audio and visual inputs, extended from a pre-trained large language model (LLM). We collect approximately 200,000 hours of audio, around 130,000 hours of video data, and about 20,000 alignment samples to build the model. The final model demonstrates capabilities that are difficult to achieve in previous systems, such as generalized object manipulation. This work performs a preliminary exploration of the end-to-end approach in this field, aiming to inspire further research towards scaling up."

Despite their promising performance, current CVGL methods face significant challenges. These methods use camera and odometry data, typically absent in real-world scenarios. They utilize multiple adjacent frames and various encoders for feature extraction, resulting in high computational costs. Moreover, these approaches independently predict each street-view frame's location, resulting in temporally inconsistent GPS trajectories. To address these challenges, in this work, we propose GAReT, a fully transformer-based method for CVGL that does not require camera and odometry data. We introduce GeoAdapter, a transformer-adapter module designed to efficiently aggregate image-level representations and adapt them for video inputs. Specifically, we train a transformer encoder on video frames and aerial images, then freeze the encoder to optimize the GeoAdapter module to obtain video-level representation. To address temporally inconsistent trajectories, we introduce TransRetriever, an encoder-decoder transformer model that predicts GPS locations of street-view frames by encoding top-k nearest neighbor predictions per frame and auto-regressively decoding the best neighbor based on the previous frame's predictions.

This assumption yields more precise pixel-level predictions and more accurately mirrors the real-world image distribution. By further employing the inverse-Gamma distribution as an intermediary prior for each mixture component, our probabilistic model achieves improved depth estimation compared to its counterpart with the single Gaussian and effectively captures the model uncertainty, which enables a strong cross-domain generation ability. We evaluated our method for stereo matching by training the model using the Scene Flow dataset and testing it on KITTI 2015 and Middlebury 2014. The experiment results consistently show that our method brings improvements over the baseline methods in a trustworthy manner.

Therefore, we propose an innovative lightweight and robust network (LR-Net), which abandons the complex structure and achieves an effective balance between detection accuracy and resource consumption. Specifically, to ensure the lightweight and robustness, on the one hand, we construct a lightweight feature extraction attention (LFEA) module, which can fully extract target features and strengthen information interaction across channels. On the other hand, we construct a simple refined feature transfer (RFT) module. Compared with direct cross-layer connections, the RFT module can improve the network's feature refinement extraction capability with little resource consumption. Meanwhile, to solve the problem of small target loss in high-level feature maps, on the one hand, we propose a low-level feature distribution (LFD) strategy to use low-level features to supplement the information of high-level features. On the other hand, we introduce an efficient simplified bilinear interpolation attention module (SBAM) to promote the guidance constraints of low-level features on high-level features and the fusion of the two. In addition, We abandon the traditional resizing method and adopt a new training and inference cropping strategy, which is more robust to datasets with multi-scale samples. Extensive experimental results show that our LR-Net achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance.

Specifically, we introduce label evolution with single point supervision (LESPS) framework and explore the performance of various excellent infrared small target detection networks based on this framework. Meanwhile, to improve the comprehensive performance, we construct a complete post-processing strategy. On the one hand, to improve the segmentation accuracy, we use a combination of test-time augmentation (TTA) and conditional random field (CRF) for post-processing. On the other hand, to improve the detection rate, we introduce an adjustable sensitivity (AS) strategy for post-processing, which fully considers the advantages of multiple detection results and reasonably adds some areas with low confidence to the fine segmentation image in the form of centroid points. In addition, to further improve the performance and explore the characteristics of this task, on the one hand, we construct and find that a multi-stage loss is helpful for fine-grained detection.

Experience and common sense suggest that there is a significant correlation between different actions, which provides valuable prior knowledge for the action anticipation task. However, previous methods have not effectively modeled this underlying statistical relationship. To address this issue, we propose a novel end-to-end video modeling architecture that utilizes attention mechanisms, named Anticipation via Recognition and Reasoning (ARR). ARR decomposes the action anticipation task into action recognition and sequence reasoning tasks, and effectively learns the statistical relationship between actions by next action prediction (NAP). In comparison to existing temporal aggregation strategies, ARR is able to extract more effective features from observable videos to make more reasonable predictions. In addition, to address the challenge of relationship modeling that requires extensive training data, we propose an innovative approach for the unsupervised pre-training of the decoder, which leverages the inherent temporal dynamics of video to enhance the reasoning capabilities of the network. Extensive experiments on the Epic-kitchen-100, EGTEA Gaze+, and 50salads datasets demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed methods. The code is available at this https URL."

This work applied the Mahalanobis distance (MD) post hoc to the bottleneck features of four Swin UNETR and nnU-net models that segmented the liver on T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging and computed tomography. By reducing the dimensions of the bottleneck features with either principal component analysis or uniform manifold approximation and projection, images the models failed on were detected with high performance and minimal computational load.

Our insight is that since contemporary generative models learn an accurate representation of their training data, we can use them to summarize the data by mining for visual patterns. Concretely, we show that after finetuning conditional diffusion models to synthesize images from a specific dataset, we can use these models to define a typicality measure on that dataset. This measure assesses how typical visual elements are for different data labels, such as geographic location, time stamps, semantic labels, or even the presence of a disease. This analysis-by-synthesis approach to data mining has two key advantages. First, it scales much better than traditional correspondence-based approaches since it does not require explicitly comparing all pairs of visual elements. Second, while most previous works on visual data mining focus on a single dataset, our approach works on diverse datasets in terms of content and scale, including a historical car dataset, a historical face dataset, a large worldwide street-view dataset, and an even larger scene dataset. Furthermore, our approach allows for translating visual elements across class labels and analyzing consistent changes."

Once trained, the method is evaluated in a classical way using state-of-the-art iris PAD benchmarks. We designed two generative models for the synthesis of ISO/IEC 19794-6-compliant iris images. The first model synthesizes bona fide-looking samples. To avoid ``identity leakage,'' the generated samples that accidentally matched those used in the model's training were excluded. The second model synthesizes images of irises with textured contact lenses and is conditioned by a given contact lens brand to have better control over textured contact lens appearance when forming the training set. Our experiments demonstrate that models trained solely on synthetic data achieve a lower but still reasonable performance when compared to solutions trained with iris images collected from human subjects. This is the first-of-its-kind attempt to use solely synthetic data to train a fully-functional iris PAD solution, and despite the performance gap between regular and the proposed methods, this study demonstrates that with the increasing fidelity of generative models, creating such privacy-safe iris PAD methods may be possible.

While prior studies have demonstrated encouraging outcomes in segmenting the visible parts of objects within a scene, amodal segmentation, in particular, has the potential to allow robots to infer the occluded parts of objects. To this end, this paper introduces a new framework that explores amodal segmentation for robotic grasping in cluttered scenes, thus greatly enhancing robotic grasping abilities. Initially, we use a conventional segmentation algorithm to detect the visible segments of the target object, which provides shape priors for completing the full object mask. Particularly, to explore how to utilize semantic features from RGB images and geometric information from depth images, we propose a Linear-fusion Attention-guided Convolutional Network (LAC-Net). LAC-Net utilizes the linear-fusion strategy to effectively fuse this cross-modal data, and then uses the prior visible mask as attention map to guide the network to focus on target feature locations for further complete mask recovery. Using the amodal mask of the target object provides advantages in selecting more accurate and robust grasp points compared to relying solely on the visible segments.

Earlier studies have investigated the use of multiple contrasts for MRI super-resolution (MCSR), whereas majority of them did not fully exploit the rich contrast-invariant structural information. To fully utilize such crucial prior knowledge of multi-contrast MRI, in this work, we propose a novel structure-guided MCSR (SGSR) framework based on a new spatio-frequency co-query attention (CQA) mechanism. Specifically, CQA performs attention on features of multiple contrasts with a shared structural query, which is particularly designed to extract, fuse, and refine the common structures from different contrasts.

Extensive experiments on a large-scale tri-domain dataset verify the effectiveness of AMPere in obtaining a unified multimodal product representation that clearly improves cross-domain product retrieval."

        "abstract": "The need for improved diagnostic methods in ophthalmology is acute, especially in the less developed regions with limited access to specialists and advanced equipment. Therefore, we introduce VisionUnite, a novel vision-language foundation model for ophthalmology enhanced with clinical knowledge. VisionUnite has been pretrained on an extensive dataset comprising 1.24 million image-text pairs, and further refined using our proposed MMFundus dataset, which includes 296,379 high-quality fundus image-text pairs and 889,137 simulated doctor-patient dialogue instances. Our experiments indicate that VisionUnite outperforms existing generative foundation models such as GPT-4V and Gemini Pro. It also demonstrates diagnostic capabilities comparable to junior ophthalmologists. VisionUnite performs well in various clinical scenarios including open-ended multi-disease diagnosis, clinical explanation, and patient interaction, making it a highly versatile tool for initial ophthalmic disease screening. VisionUnite can also serve as an educational aid for junior ophthalmologists, accelerating their acquisition of knowledge regarding both common and rare ophthalmic conditions. VisionUnite represents a significant advancement in ophthalmology, with broad implications for diagnostics, medical education, and understanding of disease mechanisms."

        "title": "Multistain Pretraining for Slide Representation Learning in Pathology",
        "abstract": "Developing self-supervised learning (SSL) models that can learn universal and transferable representations of H&E gigapixel whole-slide images (WSIs) is becoming increasingly valuable in computational pathology. These models hold the potential to advance critical tasks such as few-shot classification, slide retrieval, and patient stratification. Existing approaches for slide representation learning extend the principles of SSL from small images (e.g., 224 x 224 patches) to entire slides, usually by aligning two different augmentations (or views) of the slide. Yet the resulting representation remains constrained by the limited clinical and biological diversity of the views. Instead, we postulate that slides stained with multiple markers, such as immunohistochemistry, can be used as different views to form a rich task-agnostic training signal. To this end, we introduce Madeleine, a multimodal pretraining strategy for slide representation learning. Madeleine is trained with a dual global-local cross-stain alignment objective on large cohorts of breast cancer samples (N=4,211 WSIs across five stains) and kidney transplant samples (N=12,070 WSIs across four stains). We demonstrate the quality of slide representations learned by Madeleine on various downstream evaluations, ranging from morphological and molecular classification to prognostic prediction, comprising 21 tasks using 7,299 WSIs from multiple medical centers.

        "abstract": "Analyzing human motion is an active research area, with various applications. In this work, we focus on human motion analysis in the context of physical rehabilitation using a robot coach system. Computer-aided assessment of physical rehabilitation entails evaluation of patient performance in completing prescribed rehabilitation exercises, based on processing movement data captured with a sensory system, such as RGB and RGB-D cameras. As 2D and 3D human pose estimation from RGB images had made impressive improvements, we aim to compare the assessment of physical rehabilitation exercises using movement data obtained from both RGB-D camera (Microsoft Kinect) and estimation from RGB videos (OpenPose and BlazePose algorithms). A Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is employed from position (and orientation) features, with performance metrics defined based on the log-likelihood values from GMM. The evaluation is performed on a medical database of clinical patients carrying out low back-pain rehabilitation exercises, previously coached by robot Poppy."

        "abstract": "Federated Learning (FL) is an emerging distributed machine learning paradigm that allows multiple clients to collaboratively train a global model without sharing private local data. However, FL systems are vulnerable to attacks from malicious clients, who can degrade the global model performance through data poisoning and model poisoning. Existing defense methods typically focus on a single type of attack, such as Byzantine attacks or backdoor attacks, and are often ineffective against potential data poisoning attacks like label flipping and label shuffling. Additionally, these methods often lack accuracy and robustness in detecting and handling malicious updates. To address these issues, we propose a novel method based on model confidence scores, which evaluates the uncertainty of client model updates to detect and defend against malicious clients. Our approach is comprehensively effective for both model poisoning and data poisoning attacks and is capable of accurately identifying and mitigating potential malicious updates from being aggregated. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves the robustness of FL systems against various types of attacks, also achieving higher model accuracy and stability across various scenarios."

        "abstract": "Virtual try-on (VTO) applications aim to improve the online shopping experience by allowing users to preview garments, before making purchase decisions. However, many VTO tools fail to consider the crucial relationship between a garment's size and the user's body size, often employing a one-size-fits-all approach when visualizing a clothing item. This results in poor size recommendations and purchase decisions leading to increased return rates. To address this limitation, we introduce SiCo, an online VTO system, where users can upload images of themselves and visualize how different sizes of clothing would look on their body to help make better-informed purchase decisions. Our user study shows SiCo's superiority over baseline VTO. The results indicate that our approach significantly enhances user ability to gauge the appearance of outfits on their bodies and boosts their confidence in selecting clothing sizes that match desired goals. Based on our evaluation, we believe our VTO design has the potential to reduce return rates and enhance the online clothes shopping experience. Our code is available at this https URL."

        "abstract": "The conditional diffusion model (CDM) enhances the standard diffusion model by providing more control, improving the quality and relevance of the outputs, and making the model adaptable to a wider range of complex tasks. However, inaccurate conditional inputs in the inverse process of CDM can easily lead to generating fixed errors in the neural network, which diminishes the adaptability of a well-trained model. The existing methods like data augmentation, adversarial training, robust optimization can improve the robustness, while they often face challenges such as high computational complexity, limited applicability to unknown perturbations, and increased training difficulty. In this paper, we propose a lightweight solution, the Robust Conditional Diffusion Model (RCDM), based on control theory to dynamically reduce the impact of noise and significantly enhance the model's robustness. RCDM leverages the collaborative interaction between two neural networks, along with optimal control strategies derived from control theory, to optimize the weights of two networks during the sampling process. Unlike conventional techniques, RCDM establishes a mathematical relationship between fixed errors and the weights of the two neural networks without incurring additional computational overhead. Extensive experiments were conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness and adaptability of our proposed model."

        "abstract": "Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) is an advanced medical imaging modality that captures optical data across a broad spectral range, providing novel insights into the biochemical composition of tissues. HSI may enable precise differentiation between various tissue types and pathologies, making it particularly valuable for tumour detection, tissue classification, and disease diagnosis.\nDeep learning-based segmentation methods have shown considerable advancements, offering automated and accurate results. However, these methods face challenges with HSI datasets due to limited annotated data and discrepancies from hardware and acquisition techniques~\\cite{clancy2020surgical,studier2023heiporspectral}. Variability in clinical protocols also leads to different definitions of structure boundaries. Interactive segmentation methods, utilizing user knowledge and clinical insights, can overcome these issues and achieve precise segmentation results \\cite{zhao2013overview}.\nThis work introduces a scribble-based interactive segmentation framework for medical hyperspectral images. The proposed method utilizes deep learning for feature extraction and a geodesic distance map generated from user-provided scribbles to obtain the segmentation results. The experiment results show that utilising the geodesic distance maps based on deep learning-extracted features achieved better segmentation results than geodesic distance maps directly generated from hyperspectral images, reconstructed RGB images, or Euclidean distance maps."

        "abstract": "Recent work has uncovered alarming disparities in the performance of machine learning models in healthcare. In this study, we explore whether such disparities are present in the UK Biobank fundus retinal images by training and evaluating a disease classification model on these images. We assess possible disparities across various population groups and find substantial differences despite strong overall performance of the model. In particular, we discover unfair performance for certain assessment centres, which is surprising given the rigorous data standardisation protocol. We compare how these differences emerge and apply a range of existing bias mitigation methods to each one. A key insight is that each disparity has unique properties and responds differently to the mitigation methods. We also find that these methods are largely unable to enhance fairness, highlighting the need for better bias mitigation methods tailored to the specific type of bias."

        "abstract": "Intent obfuscation is a common tactic in adversarial situations, enabling the attacker to both manipulate the target system and avoid culpability. Surprisingly, it has rarely been implemented in adversarial attacks on machine learning systems. We are the first to propose incorporating intent obfuscation in generating adversarial examples for object detectors: by perturbing another non-overlapping object to disrupt the target object, the attacker hides their intended target. We conduct a randomized experiment on 5 prominent detectors -- YOLOv3, SSD, RetinaNet, Faster R-CNN, and Cascade R-CNN -- using both targeted and untargeted attacks and achieve success on all models and attacks. We analyze the success factors characterizing intent obfuscating attacks, including target object confidence and perturb object sizes. We then demonstrate that the attacker can exploit these success factors to increase success rates for all models and attacks. Finally, we discuss known defenses and legal repercussions."

The heavy reliance on road transport, coupled with the underutilization of the railway system, results in congested highways, prolonged transportation times, higher costs, and increased carbon emissions.

We utilize an agent-based simulation to replicate real-world scenarios, focusing on the intricacies of interactions in a modified intermodal inbound freight system for the SPPC. This involves relocating container classification to potential warehouses in California, Utah, Arizona, and Nevada, rather than exclusively at port areas. Our primary aim is to evaluate the proposed system's efficiency, considering cost and freight throughput, while also examining the effects of workforce shortages. Computational analysis suggests that strategically installing intermodal capabilities in select warehouses can reduce transportation costs, boost throughput, and foster resour"

        "abstract": "The increase in high-dimensional multiomics data demands advanced integration models to capture the complexity of human diseases. Graph-based deep learning integration models, despite their promise, struggle with small patient cohorts and high-dimensional features, often applying independent feature selection without modeling relationships among omics. Furthermore, conventional graph-based omics models focus on homogeneous graphs, lacking multiple types of nodes and edges to capture diverse structures. We introduce a Heterogeneous Graph ATtention network for omics integration (HeteroGATomics) to improve cancer diagnosis. HeteroGATomics performs joint feature selection through a multi-agent system, creating dedicated networks of feature and patient similarity for each omic modality. These networks are then combined into one heterogeneous graph for learning holistic omic-specific representations and integrating predictions across modalities. Experiments on three cancer multiomics datasets demonstrate HeteroGATomics' superior performance in cancer diagnosis. Moreover, HeteroGATomics enhances interpretability by identifying important biomarkers contributing to the diagnosis outcomes."
