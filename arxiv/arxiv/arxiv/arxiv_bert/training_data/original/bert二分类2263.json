        "abstract": "novel view acoustic synthesis (nv as) aims to render binaural audio at any target viewpoint, given a mono audio emitted by a sound source at a 3d scene. existing methods have proposed nerf-based implicit models to exploit visual cues as a condition for synthesizing binaural audio. however, in addition to low efficiency originating from heavy nerf rendering, these methods all have a limited ability of characterizing the entire scene environment such as room geometry, material prop- erties, and the spatial relation between the listener and sound source. to address these issues, we propose a novel audio-visual gaussian splatting (a v-gs) model. to obtain a material-aware and geometry-aware condition for audio synthesis, we learn an explicit point-based scene representation with an audio-guidance param- eter on locally initialized gaussian points, taking into account the space relation from the listener and sound source. to make the visual scene model audio adaptive, we propose a point densification and pruning strategy to optimally distribute the gaussian points, with the per-point contribution in sound propagation (e.g., more points needed for texture-less wall surfaces as they affect sound path diversion). extensive experiments validate the superiority of our a v-gs over existing alterna- tives on the real-world rwas and simulation-based soundspaces datasets. project page: https://surrey-uplab.github.io/research/avgs/ "

        "abstract": "the diversity of recommendation is equally crucial as accuracy in improving user experience. existing studies, e.g., determinantal point process (dpp) and maximal marginal relevance (mmr), em- ploy a greedy paradigm to iteratively select items that optimize both accuracy and diversity. however, prior methods typically exhibit quadratic complexity, limiting their applications to the re-ranking stage and are not applicable to other recommendation stages with a larger pool of candidate items, such as the pre-ranking andranking stages. in this paper, we propose contextual distillation model (cdm), an efficient recommendation model that addresses diver- sification, suitable for the deployment in all stages of industrial recommendation pipelines. specifically, cdm utilizes the candidate items in the same user request as context to enhance the diversifi- cation of the results. we propose a contrastive context encoder that employs attention mechanisms to model both positive and negative contexts. for the training of cdm, we compare each target item with its context embedding and utilize the knowledge distillation framework to learn the win probability of each target item under the mmr algorithm, where the teacher is derived from mmr outputs. during inference, ranking is performed through a linear combina- tion of the recommendation and student model scores, ensuring both diversity and efficiency. we perform offline evaluations on two industrial datasets and conduct online a/btest of cdm on the short-video platform kuaishou . the considerable enhancements \u2217equal contributions. \u2020corresponding author. permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page. copyrights for components of this work owned by others than the author(s) must be honored. abstracting with credit is permitted. to copy otherwise, or republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists, requires prior specific permission and/or a fee. request permissions from permissions@acm.org. kdd \u201924, august 25\u201329, 2024, barcelona, spain \u00a92024 copyright held by the owner/author(s). publication rights licensed to acm. acm isbn 979-8-4007-0490-1/24/08. . . $15.00 https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3671514observed in both recommendation quality and diversity, as shown by metrics, provide strong superiority for the effectiveness of cdm. ccs concepts \u2022information systems \u2192recommender systems . keywords recommender system, knowledge distillation, diversified recom- mendation acm reference format: fan li, xu si, shisong tang, dingmin wang, kunyan han, bing han, guorui zhou, yang song, and hechang chen. 2024. contextual distillation model for diversified recommendation. in proceedings of the 30th acm sigkdd conference on knowledge discovery and data mining (kdd \u201924), august 25\u201329, 2024, barcelona, spain. acm, new york, ny, usa, 10 pages. https: //doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3671514 "

        "abstract": "recommender systems aim to predict personalized rankings based on user pref- erence data. with the rise of language models (lms), lm-based recommenders have been widely explored due to their extensive world knowledge and power- ful reasoning abilities. most of the lm-based recommenders convert historical interactions into language prompts, pairing with a positive item as the target re- sponse and fine-tuning lm with a language modeling loss. however, the current objective fails to fully leverage preference data and is not optimized for personal- ized ranking tasks, which hinders the performance of lm-based recommenders. inspired by the current advancement of direct preference optimization (dpo) in human preference alignment and the success of softmax loss in recommenda- tions, we propose softmax-dpo ( s-dpo ) to instill ranking information into the lm to help lm-based recommenders distinguish preferred items from negatives, rather than solely focusing on positives. specifically, we incorporate multiple negatives in user preference data and devise an alternative version of dpo loss tailored for lm-based recommenders, connected to softmax sampling strategies. theoretically, we bridge s-dpo with the softmax loss over negative sampling and find that it has a side effect of mining hard negatives, which assures its excep- tional capabilities in recommendation tasks. empirically, extensive experiments conducted on three real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of s-dpo to effectively model user preference and further boost recommendation performance while mitigating the data likelihood decline issue of dpo. our codes are available athttps://github.com/chenyuxin1999/s-dpo .

        "abstract": "the latest breakthroughs in large language models (llms), e.g., chatdev, have catalyzed profound transformations, particularly through multi-agent collaboration for software devel- opment. llm agents can collaborate in teams like humans, and follow the waterfall model to sequentially work on requirements analysis, development, review, testing, and other phases to perform autonomous software generation. however, for an agent team, each phase in a single development process yields only one pos- sible outcome. this results in the completion of only one development chain, thereby losing the opportunity to explore multiple potential decision paths within the solution space. con- sequently, this may lead to obtaining subop- timal results. to address this challenge, we introduce cross-teamcollaboration (ctc), a scalable multi-team framework that enables orchestrated teams to jointly propose various decisions and communicate with their insights in a cross-team collaboration environment for superior content generation. experimental re- sults in software development reveal a notable increase in quality compared to state-of-the- art baselines, underscoring the efficacy of our framework. the significant improvements in story generation demonstrate the promising generalization ability of our framework across various domains. we anticipate that our work will guide llm agents towards a cross-team paradigm and contribute to their significant growth in but not limited to software devel- opment. the code and data will be available at https://github.com/openbmb/chatdev .

        "abstract": "we introduce chatglm, an evolving family of large language models that we have been developing over time. this report primarily focuses on the glm-4 language series, which includes glm-4, glm-4-air, and glm-4-9b. they represent our most capable models that are trained with all the insights and lessons gained from the preceding three generations of chatglm. to date, the glm-4 models are pre-trained on ten trillions of tokens mostly in chinese and english, along with a small set of corpus from 24 languages, and aligned primarily for chinese and english usage. the high-quality alignment is achieved via a multi-stage post- training process, which involves supervised fine-tuning and learning from human feedback. evaluations show that glm-4 1) closely rivals or outperforms gpt-4 in terms of general metrics such as mmlu, gsm8k, math, bbh, gpqa, and humaneval, 2) gets close to gpt-4-turbo in instruction following as measured by ifeval, 3) matches gpt-4 turbo (128k) and claude 3 for long context tasks, and 4) outperforms gpt-4 in chinese alignments as measured by alignbench. the glm- 4 all tools model is further aligned to understand user intent and autonomously decide when and which tool(s) to use\u2014including web browser, python interpreter, text-to-image model, and user-defined functions\u2014to effectively complete complex tasks. in practical applications, it matches and even surpasses gpt-4 all tools in tasks like accessing online information via web browsing and solving math problems using python interpreter. over the course, we have open-sourced a series of models, including chatglm-6b (three generations), glm-4-9b (128k, 1m), glm-4v-9b, webglm, and codegeex, attracting over 10 million downloads on hugging face in the year 2023 alone. the open models can be accessed through https://github.com/thudm andhttps://huggingface.co/thudm . *team glm: aohan zeng, bin xu, bowen wang, chenhui zhang, da yin, diego rojas, guanyu feng, hanlin zhao, hanyu lai, hao yu, hongning wang, jiadai sun, jiajie zhang, jiale cheng, jiayi gui, jie tang, jing zhang, juanzi li, lei zhao, lindong wu, lucen zhong, mingdao liu, minlie huang, peng zhang, qinkai zheng, rui lu, shuaiqi duan, shudan zhang, shulin cao, shuxun yang, weng lam tam, wenyi zhao, xiao liu, xiao xia, xiaohan zhang, xiaotao gu, xin lv, xinghan liu, xinyi liu, xinyue yang, xixuan song, xunkai zhang, yifan an, yifan xu, yilin niu, yuantao yang, yueyan li, yushi bai, yuxiao dong, zehan qi, zhaoyu wang, zhen yang, zhengxiao du, zhenyu hou, zihan wang. \u2020team members are listed alphabetically by first name. preprint. under review.arxiv:2406.12793v1  [cs.cl]  18 jun 2024glmmar. 2021glm-10bjun. 2021glm-130bcodegeex-13baug. 2022glm-proembeddingcharacterglmjun. 2023chatglm2-6bchatglm2-6b-32kcodegeex2-6bglm-4(0116)glm-4vcogview3jan. 2024 chatglm-130bmar. 2023chatglm-6bvisualglm-6bglm-3-turbooct. 2023chatglm3-6bchatglm3-6b-32kcogvlm-17b apisopen llmsopenvlmsglm-4(0520)glm-4-air(0605)jun. 2024glm-4-9bglm-4-9b-chatglm-4-9b-chat-1mglm-4v-9bcogvlm2-19bglm-4alltools webglmcodegeexcode interpreter agentmodelsautowebglm cogviewapr. 2022cogview2cogvideo(dec.)cogagent (may) (may)(may)(128k) (32k)(128k) (jul.)oct. 2022glm-130b(32k)(aug.)glm-10bmglm-1bfigure 1: the timeline of the glm family of language, code, vision, and agent models. the focus of this report is primarily on the language models, i.e., chatglm. the apis are publicly available at https://bigmodel.cn and open models can be accessed through https://github.com/thudm .

        "abstract": "large language models, particularly multilin- gual ones, are designed, claimed, and expected to cater to native speakers of varied languages. we hypothesise that the current practices of fine-tuning and evaluating these models may mismatch this intention owing to a heavy re- liance on translation, which can introduce trans- lation artefacts and defects. it remains un- known whether the nature of the instruction data has an impact on the model output; on the other hand, it remains questionable whether translated test sets can capture such nuances. due to the often coupled practices of using translated data in both stages, such imperfec- tions could have been overlooked. this work investigates these issues by using controlled na- tive or translated data during instruction tuning and evaluation stages and observing model re- sults. experiments on eight base models and eight different benchmarks reveal that native or generation benchmarks display a notable dif- ference between native and translated instruc- tion data especially when model performance is high, whereas other types of test sets cannot. finally, we demonstrate that regularization is beneficial to bridging this gap on structured but not generative tasks.1 "

        "abstract": "reinforcement learning from human feedback (rlhf) has emerged as the primary method foraligninglargelanguagemodels(llms)withhumanpreferences. therlhfprocesstypically starts by training a reward model (rm) using human preference data. conventional rms are trained on pairwise responses to the same user request, with relative ratings indicating which response humans prefer. the trained rm serves as a proxy for human preferences. however, due to the black-box nature of rms, their outputs lack interpretability, as humans cannot intuitively understand why an rm thinks a response is good or not. as rms act as human preference proxies, it is desirable for them to be human-interpretable to ensure that their internal decision processes are consistent with human preferences and to prevent reward hacking in llm alignment. to build rms with interpretable preferences, we propose a two- stage approach: i) train an absolute-rating multi-objective reward model (armorm) with multi-dimensional absolute-rating data, each dimension corresponding to a human-interpretable objective (e.g., honesty, verbosity, safety); ii) employ a mixture-of-experts (moe) strategy with a gating network that automatically selects the most suitable reward objectives based on the context. we efficiently trained an armorm with llama-3 8b and a gating network consisting of a shallow mlp on top of the armorm. our trained model, armorm-llama3-8b , obtains state- of-the-art performance on rewardbench, a benchmark evaluating rms for language modeling. notably, the performance of our model surpasses the llm-as-a-judge method with gpt-4 judges by a margin, and approaches the performance of the much larger nemotron-4 340b reward model. our code and model are released at https://github.com/rlhflow/rlhf-rewar d-modeling .

        "abstract": "recent advances in vision-language models have significantly propelled video understanding. existing datasets and tasks, however, have notable limitations. most datasets are confined to short videos with limited events and narrow narratives. for example, datasets with instructional and egocentric videos often document the activities of one person in a single scene. although some movie datasets offer richer content, they are often limited to short-term tasks, lack publicly available videos and frequently encounter data leakage given the use of movie forums and other resources in llm training. to address the above limitations, we propose the short film dataset (sfd) with 1,078 publicly available amateur movies, a wide variety of genres and minimal data leakage issues. sfd offers long-term story-oriented video tasks in the form of multiple-choice and open-ended question preprint. under review.arxiv:2406.10221v1  [cs.cv]  14 jun 20240 200 400 600 800 average video length (seconds)0100200300400total hoursactivitynet-qahow2qa egoschemasfdmovieqa moviechat lvucinepile tvqanext-qa ivqamovies (accessible) movies (restricted) egocentric instructional generalfigure 2: comparison of sfd to other vqa datasets. the circle size indicates the number of qa pairs in each dataset. 19.728.922.126.333.528.93624.131.518.344.134.556.755.455.464.451.971.3 28.869.964.17570.268.57164.176 15253545556575 gemma2b(42.3)mistral7b(62.5)llama 38b(68.4)gpt-3.5(70)mixtral8x7b(70.6)claude 3haiku(75.2)claude 3sonnet(79)llama 370b(82)gpt-4(86.4)% accuracyzero-shot llm accuracysfdmovieqalvuyto: youtube-objects voc: pascal voc 2007 6model and (mmlu)figure 3: data leakage. when given only the movie title, higher zero-shot accuracy in question- answering by llms indicates greater data leakage. llms are ranked by mmlu. answering. our extensive experiments emphasize the need for long-term reasoning to solve sfd tasks. notably, we find strong signals in movie transcripts leading to the on-par performance of people and llms. we also show significantly lower performance of current models compared to people when using vision data alone.

        "abstract": "despite the unprecedented success of text-to-image diffusion models, controlling the number of depicted objects using text is surprisingly hard. this is important for various applications from technical documents, to children\u2019s books to illustrating cooking recipes. generating object-correct counts is fundamentally challenging because the generative model needs to keep a sense of separate identity for every instance of the object, even if several objects look identical or overlap, and then carry out a global computation implicitly during generation. it is still unknown if such representations exist. to address count-correct generation, we first identify features within the diffusion model that can carry the object identity information. we then use them to separate and count instances of objects during the denoising process and detect over-generation and under-generation. we fix the latter by training a model that predicts both the shape and location of a missing object, based on the layout of existing ones, and show how it can be used to guide denoising with correct object count. our approach, countgen , does not depend on external source to determine object layout, but rather uses the prior from the diffusion model itself, creating prompt-dependent and seed-dependent layouts. evaluated on two benchmark datasets, we find that countgen strongly outperforms the count- accuracy of existing baselines. countgen  (ours) \u201ca photo of six  kittens  sitting on a  branch\u201d \u201ca photo of \ufb01ve  eggs  in a carton\u201d \u201ca realistic photo of  goldilocks and three   bears eating a porridge\u201d \u201can illustration of  four  ninja turtles \u201d sdxl  \u201ca realistic photo of  seven  dwarves  dancing  in the forest\u201d  figure 1: countgen generates the correct number of objects specified in the input prompt while maintaining a natural layout that aligns with the prompt. preprint. under review.arxiv:2406.10210v1  [cs.cv]  14 jun 2024"

        "abstract": "real-time detection and prediction of extreme weather protect human lives and infrastructure. traditional methods rely on numerical threshold setting and manual interpretation of weather heatmaps with geographic information systems (gis), which can be slow and error-prone. our research redefines extreme weather events detection (ewed) by framing it as a visual question answering (vqa) problem, thereby introducing a more precise and automated solution. leveraging vision-language models (vlm) to simultaneously process visual and textual data, we offer an effective aid to enhance the analysis process of weather heatmaps. our initial assessment of general-purpose vlms (e.g., gpt-4-vision) on ewed revealed poor performance, characterized by low accuracy and frequent halluci- nations due to inadequate color differentiation andinsufficient meteorological knowledge . to address these challenges, we introduce climateiqa , the first mete- orological vqa dataset, which includes 8,760 wind gust heatmaps and 254,040 question-answer pairs covering four question types, both generated from the latest climate reanalysis data. we also propose sparse position and outline tracking (spot) , an innovative technique that leverages opencv and k-means clustering to capture and depict color contours in heatmaps, providing climateiqa with more accurate color spatial location information. finally, we present climate-zoo , the first meteorological vlm collection, which adapts vlms to meteorological applications using the climateiqa dataset. experiment results demonstrate that models from climate-zoo substantially outperform state-of-the-art general vlms, achieving an accuracy increase from 0% to over 90% in ewed verification. the datasets and models in this study are publicly available for future climate science research: https://github.com/alexjjjchen/climate-zoo .

        "abstract": ". traditional federated learning (fl) methods have limited support for clients with varying computational and communication abil- ities, leading to inefficiencies and potential inaccuracies in model train- ing. this limitation hinders the widespread adoption of fl in diverse and resource-constrained environments, such as those with client devices ranging from powerful servers to mobile devices. to address this need, this paper introduces federated learning with flexible architectures (fedfa), an fl training algorithm that allows clients to train models of different widths and depths. each client can select a network architec- ture suitable for its resources, with shallower and thinner networks re- quiring fewer computing resources for training. unlike prior work in this area, fedfa incorporates the layer grafting technique to align clients\u2019 lo- cal architectures with the largest network architecture in the fl system during model aggregation. layer grafting ensures that all client contribu- tions are uniformly integrated into the global model, thereby minimizing the risk of any individual client\u2019s data skewing the model\u2019s parameters disproportionately and introducing security benefits. moreover, fedfa introduces the scalable aggregation method to manage scale variations in weights among different network architectures. experimentally, fedfa outperforms previous width and depth flexible aggregation strategies. specifically, fedfa\u2019s testing accuracy matches (1.00 times) or is up to 1.16 times higher globally for iid settings, 0.98 to 1.13 times locally, and 0.95 times to 1.20 times higher globally for non-iid settings com- pared to earlier strategies. furthermore, fedfa demonstrates increased robustness against performance degradation in backdoor attack scenar- ios compared to earlier strategies. earlier strategies exhibit more drops in testing accuracy under attacks\u2014for iid data by 1.01 to 2.11 times globally, and for non-iid data by 0.89 to 3.31 times locally, and 1.11 to 1.74 times globally, compared to fedfa. keywords: federated learning \u00b7heterogeneous local network archi- tectures \u00b7backdoor attack "

        "abstract": "vision transformers (vits) have emerged as a significant area of focus, particularly for their ca- pacity to be jointly trained with large language models and to serve as robust vision foundation models. yet, the development of trustworthy ex- planation methods for vits has lagged, partic- ularly in the context of post-hoc interpretations of vit predictions. existing sub-image selection approaches, such as feature-attribution and con- ceptual models, fall short in this regard. this pa- per proposes five desiderata for explaining vits \u2013 faithfulness, stability, sparsity, multi-level struc- ture, and parsimony \u2013 and demonstrates the in- adequacy of current methods in meeting these criteria comprehensively. we introduce a varia- tional bayesian explanation framework, dubbed probabilistic concept explainers (pace), which models the distributions of patch embeddings to provide trustworthy post-hoc conceptual explana- tions. our qualitative analysis reveals the distri- butions of patch-level concepts, elucidating the effectiveness of vits by modeling the joint distri- bution of patch embeddings and vit\u2019s predictions. moreover, these patch-level explanations bridge the gap between image-level and dataset-level ex- planations, thus completing the multi-level struc- ture of pace. through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real-world datasets, we demon- strate that pace surpasses state-of-the-art meth- ods in terms of the defined desiderata1. *equal contribution1department of computer science, rutgers university, new jersey, usa. correspondence to: hengyi wang <hengyi.wang@rutgers.edu >. proceedings of the 41stinternational conference on machine learning , vienna, austria. pmlr 235, 2024. copyright 2024 by the author(s). 1code will soon be available at https://github.com/wang-ml- lab/interpretable-foundation-models1"

        "abstract": "recent advances in discriminative and generative pretraining have yielded geometry estimation models with strong generalization capabilities. while discriminative monocular geometry estimation methods rely on large-scale fine-tuning data to achieve zero-shot generalization, several generative-based paradigms show the potential of achieving impressive generalization performance on unseen scenes by leveraging pre-trained diffusion models and fine-tuning on even a small scale of synthetic training data. frustratingly, these models are trained with different recipes on different datasets, making it hard to find out the critical factors that determine the evaluation performance. besides, the current widely used geometry evaluation benchmarks have two main drawbacks that may prevent the development of the field, i.e.,limited scene diversity andunfavorable label quality . to resolve the above issues, (1) we build fair and strong baselines in a unified codebase for evaluating and analyzing the state-of-the-art (sota) geometry estimation models in terms of both different finetuning paradigms and training recipes; (2) we evaluate monocular geometry estimators on more challenging benchmarks for geometry estimation task with diverse scenes and high-quality annotations. our results reveal that pre-trained using large data, discriminative models such as dinov2, can outperform generative counterparts with a small amount of high-quality synthetic training data under the same training configuration, which suggests that fine-tuning data quality is a more important factor than the data scale and model architecture. our observation also raises a question: if simply fine-tuning a general vision model such as dinov2 using a small amount of synthetic depth data produces sota results, do we really need complex models, e.g., marigold [ koh+24] and depthfm [ gfp+24] for depth estimation? we believe that this work can propel advancements in geometry estimation tasks and a wide range of other downstream vision tasks.

        "abstract": "a key goal in mechanistic interpretability is circuit analysis: finding sparse sub- graphs of models corresponding to specific behaviors or capabilities. however, mlp sublayers make fine-grained circuit analysis on transformer-based language models difficult. in particular, interpretable features\u2014such as those found by sparse autoencoders (saes)\u2014are typically linear combinations of extremely many neu- rons, each with its own nonlinearity to account for. circuit analysis in this setting thus either yields intractably large circuits or fails to disentangle local and global behavior. to address this we explore transcoders , which seek to faithfully approx- imate a densely activating mlp layer with a wider, sparsely-activating mlp layer. we successfully train transcoders on language models with 120m, 410m, and 1.4b parameters, and find them to perform at least on par with saes in terms of sparsity, faithfulness, and human-interpretability. we then introduce a novel method for using transcoders to perform weights-based circuit analysis through mlp sublay- ers. the resulting circuits neatly factorize into input-dependent and input-invariant terms. finally, we apply transcoders to reverse-engineer unknown circuits in the model, and we obtain novel insights regarding the \u201cgreater-than circuit\u201d in gpt2- small. our results suggest that transcoders can prove effective in decomposing model computations involving mlps into interpretable circuits. code is available athttps://github.com/jacobdunefsky/transcoder_circuits .

        "abstract": "recently, artificial intelligence techniques for education have been received increas- ing attentions, while it still remains an open problem to design the effective music instrument instructing systems. although key presses can be directly derived from sheet music, the transitional movements among key presses require more extensive guidance in piano performance. in this work, we construct a piano-hand motion generation benchmark to guide hand movements and fingerings for piano playing. to this end, we collect an annotated dataset, pianomotion10m , consisting of 116 hours of piano playing videos from a bird\u2019s-eye view with 10 million annotated hand poses. we also introduce a powerful baseline model that generates hand motions from piano audios through a position predictor and a position-guided gesture generator. furthermore, a series of evaluation metrics are designed to assess the performance of the baseline model, including motion similarity, smooth- ness, positional accuracy of left and right hands, and overall fidelity of movement distribution. despite that piano key presses with respect to music scores or audios are already accessible, pianomotion10m aims to provide guidance on piano fingering for instruction purposes. the dataset and source code can be accessed at https://agnjason.github.io/pianomotion-page .

(ii) we examine the impact of combining synthetic data with the most informative samples from an unlabelled dataset. first, we use the synthetic data to select the most informative samples, second, we combine both these samples and the synthetic data for fine-tuning. this approach reduces labelling effort and consistently surpasses the performance of the baseline model that is trained with fully labeled data. overall, we show in comprehensive experiments that llm- generated data greatly improves stance detection performance for online political discussions.

Due to the lack of benchmarks, the community still needs to fully understand the hallucination issues within these models. To address this challenge, we intro- duce a comprehensive diagnostic benchmark, ToolBH. Specifically, we assess the LLM’s hallucinations through two perspectives: depth and breadth. In terms of depth, we propose a multi-level diagnostic process, including (1) solvability detection, (2) solution planning, and (3) missing-tool analysis. For breadth, we consider three scenarios based on the characteristics of the toolset: missing necessary tools, potential tools, and limited functionality tools. Furthermore, we developed seven tasks and collected 700 evaluation samples through multiple rounds of manual annotation. The results show the significant challenges presented by the ToolBH benchmark. The current advanced models Gemini-1.5-Pro and GPT-4o only achieve a total score of 45.3 and 37.0, respectively, on a scale of 100. In this benchmark, larger model parameters do not guarantee better performance; the training data and response strategies also play a crucial role in tool-enhanced LLM scenarios. Our diagnostic analysis indicates that the primary reason for model errors lies in assessing task solvability. Additionally, open-weight models suffer from performance drops with verbose replies, whereas proprietary models excel with longer reasoning."

        "abstract": "the rise of online multi-modal sharing platforms like tiktok and youtube has enabled personalized recommender systems to incor- porate multiple modalities (such as visual, textual, and acoustic) into user representations. however, addressing the challenge of data sparsity in these systems remains a key issue. to address this limitation, recent research has introduced self-supervised learn- ing techniques to enhance recommender systems. however, these methods often rely on simplistic random augmentation or intu- itive cross-view information, which can introduce irrelevant noise and fail to accurately align the multi-modal context with user- item interaction modeling. to fill this research gap, we propose a novel multi-modal graph diffusion model for recommendation called diffmm. our framework integrates a modality-aware graph diffusion model with a cross-modal contrastive learning paradigm to improve modality-aware user representation learning. this inte- gration facilitates better alignment between multi-modal feature information and collaborative relation modeling. our approach leverages diffusion models\u2019 generative capabilities to automatically generate a user-item graph that is aware of different modalities, facilitating the incorporation of useful multi-modal knowledge in modeling user-item interactions. we conduct extensive experiments on three public datasets, consistently demonstrating the superiority of our diffmm over various competitive baselines. for open-sourced model implementation details, you can access the source codes of our proposed framework at: https://github.com/hkuds/diffmm. acm reference format: yangqin jiang, lianghao xia, wei wei, da luo, kangyi lin, and chao huang. 2024. diffmm: multi-modal diffusion model for recommendation. in pro- ceedings of acm conference (conference\u201917). acm, new york, ny, usa, 11 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/nnnnnnn.nnnnnnn "

        "abstract": "as online music consumption increasingly shifts towards playlist- based listening, the task of playlist continuation , in which an al- gorithm suggests songs to extend a playlist in a personalized and musically cohesive manner, has become vital to the success of music streaming services. currently, many existing playlist continuation approaches rely on collaborative filtering methods to perform their recommendations. however, such methods will struggle to rec- ommend songs that lack interaction data, an issue known as the cold-start problem. current approaches to this challenge design complex mechanisms for extracting relational signals from sparse collaborative signals and integrating them into content represen- tations. however, these approaches leave content representation learning out of scope and utilize frozen, pre-trained content models that may not be aligned with the distribution or format of a specific musical setting. furthermore, even the musical state-of-the-art con- tent modules are either (1) incompatible with the cold-start setting or (2) unable to effectively integrate cross-modal and relational signals. in this paper, we introduce larp , a multi-modal cold-start playlist continuation model, to effectively overcome these limita- tions. larp is a three-stage contrastive learning framework that integrates both multi-modal and relational signals into its learned representations. our framework uses increasing stages of task- specific abstraction: within-track (language-audio) contrastive loss, track-track contrastive loss, and track-playlist contrastive loss. ex- perimental results on two publicly available datasets demonstrate the efficacy of larp over uni-modal and multi-modal models for playlist continuation in a cold-start setting. finally, this work pio- neers the perspective of addressing cold-start recommendation via \u2217equal contribution. \u2020this work was mainly done while rebecca was visiting the national university of singapore. \u2021corresponding author. permission to make digital or hard copies of all or part of this work for personal or classroom use is granted without fee provided that copies are not made or distributed for profit or commercial advantage and that copies bear this notice and the full citation on the first page. copyrights for components of this work owned by others than the author(s) must be honored. abstracting with credit is permitted. to copy otherwise, or republish, to post on servers or to redistribute to lists, requires prior specific permission and/or a fee. request permissions from permissions@acm.org. kdd \u201924, august 25\u201329, 2024, barcelona, spain \u00a92024 copyright held by the owner/author(s). publication rights licensed to acm. acm isbn 979-8-4007-0490-1/24/08 https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528.3671772relational representation learning. code and dataset are released at: https://github.com/rsalganik1123/larp. ccs concepts \u2022information systems \u2192recommender systems ;\u2022applied computing\u2192sound and music computing . keywords music playlist continuation, music representation learning, language- audio pre-training, cold-start problem acm reference format: rebecca salganik, xiaohao liu, yunshan ma, jian kang, and tat-seng chua. 2024. larp: language audio relational pre-training for cold-start playlist continuation. in proceedings of the 30th acm sigkdd conference on knowl- edge discovery and data mining (kdd \u201924), august 25\u201329, 2024, barcelona, spain. acm, new york, ny, usa, 12 pages. https://doi.org/10.1145/3637528. 3671772 "

        "abstract": "Clean-label indiscriminate poisoning attacks add invisible perturbations to correctly labeled training images, thus dramatically reducing the generalization capability of the victim models. Recently, defense mechanisms such as adversarial training, image transformation techniques, and image purification have been proposed. However, these schemes are either susceptible to adaptive attacks, built on unrealistic assumptions, or only effective against specific poison types, limiting their universal applicability. In this research, we propose a more universally effective, practical, and robust defense scheme called ECLIPSE. We first investigate the impact of Gaussian noise on the poisons and theoretically prove that any kind of poison will be largely assimilated when imposing sufficient random noise. In light of this, we assume the victim has access to an extremely limited number of clean images (a more practical scene) and subsequently enlarge this sparse set for training a denoising probabilistic model (a universal denoising tool). We then introduce Gaussian noise to absorb the poisons and apply the model for denoising, resulting in a roughly purified dataset. Finally, to address the trade-off of the inconsistency in the assimilation sensitivity of different poisons by Gaussian noise, we propose a lightweight corruption compensation module to effectively eliminate residual poisons, providing a more universal defense approach. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our defense approach outperforms 10 state-of-the-art defenses. We also propose an adaptive attack against ECLIPSE and verify the robustness of our defense scheme. Our code is available at https://github.com/CGCL-codes/ECLIPSE.",

In this paper, we release VIDEOFEEDBACK, the first largescale dataset containing human-provided multiaspect score over 37.6K synthesized videos from 11 existing video generative models. We train VIDEOSCORE (initialized from Mantis) based on VIDEOFEEDBACK to enable automatic video quality assessment. Experiments show that the Spearman correlation between VIDEOSCORE and humans can reach 77.1 on VIDEOFEEDBACK-test, beating the prior best metrics by about 50 points. Further result on other held-out EvalCrafter, GenAI-Bench, and VBench show that VIDEOSCORE has consistently much higher correlation with human judges than other metrics. Due to these results, we believe VIDEOSCORE can serve as a great proxy for human raters to (1) rate different video models to track progress (2) simulate fine-grained human feedback in Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) to improve current video generation models.",

        "abstract": "Benchmarking vision-based driving policies is challenging. On one hand, openloop evaluation with real data is easy, but these results do not reflect closedloop performance. On the other, closed-loop evaluation is possible in simulation, but is hard to scale due to its significant computational demands. Further, the simulators available today exhibit a large domain gap to real data. This has resulted in an inability to draw clear conclusions from the rapidly growing body of research on end-to-end autonomous driving. In this paper, we present NAVSIM, a middle ground between these evaluation paradigms, where we use large datasets in combination with a non-reactive simulator to enable large-scale real-world benchmarking. Specifically, we gather simulation-based metrics, such as progress and time to collision, by unrolling bird\u2019s eye view abstractions of the test scenes for a short simulation horizon. Our simulation is non-reactive, i.e., the evaluated policy and environment do not influence each other. As we demonstrate empirically, this decoupling allows open-loop metric computation while being better aligned with closed-loop evaluations than traditional displacement errors. NAVSIM enabled a new competition held at CVPR 2024, where 143 teams submitted 463 entries, resulting in several new insights. On a large set of challenging scenarios, we observe that simple methods with moderate compute requirements such as TransFuser can match recent large-scale end-to-end driving architectures such as UniAD. Our modular framework can potentially be extended with new datasets, data curation strategies, and metrics, and will be continually maintained to host future challenges.

Few studies have systematically compared LLMs\u2019 contextualized word embeddings for languages beyond English. Here, we evaluate multiple bidirectional transformers\u2019 (BERTs\u2019) semantic representations of Spanish ambiguous nouns in context. We develop a novel dataset of minimal-pair sentences evoking the same or different sense for a target ambiguous noun. In a pre-registered study, we collect contextualized human relatedness judgments for each sentence pair. We find that various BERT-based LLMs\u2019 contextualized semantic representations capture some variance in human judgments but fall short of the human benchmark, and for Spanish\u2013unlike English\u2014model scale is uncorrelated with performance. We also identify stereotyped trajectories of target noun disambiguation as a proportion of traversal through a given LLM family\u2019s architecture, which we partially replicate in English.

        "title": "Deep-Learning Approach for Tissue Classification using Acoustic Waves during Ablation with an Er:YAG Laser (Updated)",
        "abstract": "Today\u2019s mechanical tools for bone cutting (osteotomy) cause mechanical trauma that prolongs the healing process. Medical device manufacturers constantly strive to improve their tools to further minimize the trauma. One example of such a new tool and procedure is minimally invasive surgery using a laser as the cutting element. This setup allows tissue to be ablated using laser light instead of mechanical tools, which reduces the healing time after surgery. A reliable feedback system is crucial during laser surgery to avoid collateral damage to surrounding tissues. Therefore, we propose a tissue classification method that analyzes the acoustic waves generated during laser ablation and demonstrates its applicability in an ex-vivo experiment. The ablation process with a microsecond pulsed Er:YAG laser produces acoustic waves, which were acquired with an air-coupled transducer. We then used these acquired waves to classify five porcine tissue types: hard bone, soft bone, muscle, fat, and skin. For automated tissue classification of the measured acoustic waves, we compared five Neural Network (NN) approaches: a one-dimensional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with a time-dependent input, a Fully-connected Neural Network (FcNN) with either the frequency spectrum or the principal components of the frequency spectrum as an input, and a combination of a CNN and an FcNN with the time-dependent data and its frequency spectrum as an input. In addition, several consecutive acoustic waves were used to improve the classification task. We used GradCam to find the activation map of the frequencies and concluded that the low-frequencies were the most important ones for this classification task. Our results indicated that the highest accuracy of the classification task (65.5%-75.5%) could be achieved by combining the time-dependent data with its frequency spectrum. In addition, we showed that it was sufficient to use the frequency spectrum as input and that no additional benefit was gained by applying Principal Components Analysis (PCA) to the frequency spectrum.",

        "abstract": "Developers try to evaluate whether an AI system can be misused by adversaries before releasing it; for example, they might test whether a model enables cyberoffense, user manipulation, or bioterrorism. In this work, we show that individually testing models for misuse is inadequate; adversaries can misuse combinations of models even when each individual model is safe. The adversary accomplishes this by first decomposing tasks into subtasks, then solving each subtask with the best-suited model. For example, an adversary might solve challenging-but-benign subtasks with an aligned frontier model, and easy-but-malicious subtasks with a weaker misaligned model. We study two decomposition methods: manual decomposition where a human identifies a natural decomposition of a task, and automated decomposition where a weak model generates benign tasks for a frontier model to solve, then uses the solutions in-context to solve the original task. Using these decompositions, we empirically show that adversaries can create vulnerable code, explicit images, python scripts for hacking, and manipulative tweets at much higher rates with combinations of models than either individual model. Our work suggests that even perfectly-aligned frontier systems can enable misuse without ever producing malicious outputs, and that red-teaming efforts should extend beyond single models in isolation.1",

        "abstract": "Research on dialogue constructiveness assessment focuses on (i) analysing conversational factors that influence individuals to take specific actions, win debates, change their perspectives or broaden their open-mindedness and (ii) predicting constructive outcomes following dialogues for such use cases. These objectives can be achieved by training either interpretable feature-based models (which often involve costly human annotations) or neural models such as pre-trained language models (which have empirically shown higher task accuracy but lack interpretability). We propose a novel LLM feature-based framework that combines the strengths of feature-based and neural approaches while mitigating their downsides, in assessing dialogue constructiveness. The framework first defines a set of dataset-independent and interpretable linguistic features, which can be extracted by both prompting an LLM and simple heuristics. Such features are then used to train LLM featurebased models. We apply this framework to three datasets of dialogue constructiveness and find that our LLM feature-based models significantly outperform standard feature-based models and neural models, and tend to learn more robust prediction rules instead of relying on superficial shortcuts (as seen with neural models). Further, we demonstrate that interpreting these LLM feature-based models can yield valuable insights into what makes a dialogue constructive1 .",

In this paper, we study building language-specific LLMs by adapting monolingual and multilingual LLMs. We conduct systematic experiments on how design choices (base model selection, vocabulary extension, and continued fine-tuning) impact the adapted LLM, both in terms of efficiency (how many tokens are needed to encode the same amount of information) and end task performance. We find that (1) the initial performance before the adaptation is not always indicative of the final performance. (2) Efficiency can easily improved with simple vocabulary extension and continued fine-tuning in most LLMs we study, and (3) The optimal adaptation method is highly language-dependent, and the simplest approach works well across various experimental settings. Adapting English-centric models can yield better results than adapting multilingual models despite their worse initial performance on lowresource languages.

With the advancement of Large Language Mod- els (LLMs), many researchers have employed LLMs as the ESC models. However, the evalu- ation of these LLM-based ESCs remains uncer- tain. Inspired by the awesome development of role-playing agents, we propose an ESC Evaluation framework (i.e., ESC-Eval), which uses a role-playing agent to interact with ESC models, followed by a manual evaluation of the interactive dialogues. In detail, we first re- organize 2,801 role-playing cards from seven existing datasets to define the roles of the role- playing agent. Second, we train a specific role- playing model - ESC-Role to mimic the be- havior of a real person experiencing distress. Third, through ESC-Role and organized role cards, we systematically conduct experiments using 14 LLMs as the ESC models, includ- ing general AI-assistant LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT) and ESC-oriented LLMs (e.g., ExTES-Llama). We conduct comprehensive human annotations on interactive multi-turn dialogues of differ- ent ESC models. The results show that ESC- oriented LLMs exhibit superior ESC abilities compared to general AI-assistant LLMs, but there is still a gap behind human performance.

However, despite the frequent presence of long texts in medical scenarios, evaluation benchmarks of long-context capabilities for LLMs in this field are still rare.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces RAISE (Reason- ing and Acting through Scratchpad and Examples), an advanced architecture en- hancing the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 into conver- sational agents. RAISE, an enhancement of the ReAct framework, incorporates a dual-component memory system, mirror- ing human short-term and long-term mem- ory, to maintain context and continuity in conversations. It entails a comprehen- sive agent construction scenario, includ- ing phases like Conversation Selection, Scene Extraction, CoT Completion, and Scene Augmentation, leading to the LLMs Training phase. This approach appears to enhance agent controllability and adapt- ability in complex, multi-turn dialogues. Our preliminary evaluations in a real es- tate sales context suggest that RAISE has some advantages over traditional agents, indicating its potential for broader appli- cations. This work contributes to the AI field by providing a robust framework for developing more context-aware and versa- tile conversational agents.",

        "abstract": "Spatial pyramid pooling module or encode-decoder structure are used in deep neural networks for semantic segmentation task. The former networks are able to encode multi-scale contextual information by probing the incoming features with filters or pooling operations at mul- tiple rates and multiple effective fields-of-view, while the latter networks can capture sharper object boundaries by gradually recovering the spatial information. In this work, we propose to combine the advantages from both methods. Specifically, our proposed model, DeepLabv3+, extends DeepLabv3 by adding a simple yet effective decoder module to refine the segmentation results especially along object boundaries. We further ex- plore the Xception model and apply the depthwise separable convolution to both Atrous Spatial Pyramid Pooling and decoder modules, resulting in a faster and stronger encoder-decoder network.

        "abstract": "Adaptation of semantic segmentation networks to different visual conditions is vital for robust perception in autonomous cars and robots. However, previous work has shown that most feature-level adaptation methods, which employ adversarial training and are validated on synthetic-to-real adaptation, provide marginal gains in condition-level adaptation, being outperformed by simple pixel-level adaptation via stylization. Motivated by these findings, we propose to leverage stylization in performing feature-level adaptation by aligning the internal network features extracted by the encoder of the network from the original and the stylized view of each input image with a novel feature invariance loss. In this way, we encourage the encoder to extract features that are already invariant to the style of the input, allowing the decoder to focus on parsing these features and not on further abstracting from the specific style of the input. We implement our method, named Condition-Invariant Semantic Segmentation (CISS), on the current state-of-the-art domain adaptation architecture and achieve outstanding results on condition-level adaptation. In particular, CISS sets the new state of the art in the popular daytime-to-nighttime Cityscapes\u2192Dark Zurich benchmark. Furthermore, our method achieves the second-best performance on the normal-to-adverse Cityscapes\u2192ACDC benchmark.

Although machine learning mod- els have been used for segmentation in this domain, food images pose several challenges. One challenge is that food items can overlap and mix, making them difficult to distin- guish. Another challenge is the degree of inter-class sim- ilarity and intra-class variability, which is caused by the varying preparation methods and dishes a food item may be served in. Additionally, class imbalance is an inevitable issue in food datasets. To address these issues, two models are trained and compared, one based on convolutional neu- ral networks and the other on Bidirectional Encoder repre- sentation for Image Transformers (BEiT). The models are trained and valuated using the FoodSeg103 dataset, which is identified as a robust benchmark for food image segmen- tation. The BEiT model outperforms the previous state-of- the-art model by achieving a mean intersection over union of 49.4 on FoodSeg103.

We propose a deep convolutional neural network architecture termed OrthoSeg for semantic segmentation using\nmultimodal, orthorectified and coregistered data. We also propose a training procedure for supervised training of OrthoSeg. The\ntraining procedure complements the inherent architectural characteristics of OrthoSeg for preventing complex co-adaptations of\nlearned features, which may arise due to probable high dimensionality and spatial correlation in multimodal and/or multispectral\ncoregistered data. OrthoSeg consists of parallel encoding networks for independent encoding of multimodal feature maps and a\ndecoder designed for efficiently fusing independently encoded multimodal feature maps. A softmax layer at the end of the network\nuses the features generated by the decoder for pixel-wise classification. The decoder fuses feature maps from the parallel encoders\nlocally as well as contextually at multiple scales to generate per-pixel feature maps for final pixel-wise classification resulting in\nsegmented output. We experimentally show the merits of OrthoSeg by demonstrating state-of-the-art accuracy on the ISPRS\nPotsdam 2D Semantic Segmentation dataset. Adaptability is one of the key motivations behind OrthoSeg so that it serves as a useful\narchitectural option for a wide range of problems involving the task of semantic segmentation of coregistered multimodal and/or\nmultispectral imagery.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we address two critical challenges in the domain of flood detection: the computational expense of large- scale time series change detection and the lack of interpretable decision-making processes on explainable AI (XAI). To overcome these challenges, we proposed an interpretable multi-stage approach to flood detection, IMAFD has been proposed. It provides an automatic, efficient and interpretable solution suitable for large-scale remote sensing tasks and offers insight into the decision-making process. The proposed IMAFD approach combines the analysis of the dynamic time series image sequences to identify images with possible flooding with the static, within-image semantic segmentation. It combines anomaly detection (at both image and pixel level) with semantic segmentation. The flood detection problem is addressed through four stages: (1) at a sequence level: identifying the suspected images (2) at a multi-image level: detecting change within suspected images (3) at an image level: semantic segmentation of images into Land, Water or Cloud class (4) decision making. Our contributions are two folder. First, we efficiently reduced the number of frames to be processed for dense change detection by providing a multi-stage holistic approach to flood detection. Second, the proposed semantic change detection method (stage 3) provides human users with an interpretable decision-making process, while most of the explainable AI (XAI) methods provide post hoc explanations. The evaluation of the proposed IMAFD framework was performed on three datasets, WorldFloods, RavAEn and MediaEval. For all the above datasets, the proposed framework demonstrates a competitive performance compared to other methods offering also interpretability and insight.",

Through our work, we study the usefulness of SSL for Fine-Grained Visual Categoriza- tion (FGVC). FGVC aims to distinguish objects of visually similar sub categories within a general category. The small inter-class, but large intra-class variations within the dataset makes it a challenging task. The limited availability of annotated labels for such a fine-grained data encourages the need for SSL, where additional supervision can boost learning without the cost of extra annotations. Our baseline achieves 86.36% top-1 classification accuracy on CUB-200-2011 dataset by utiliz- ing random crop augmentation during training and center crop augmentation during testing. In this work, we explore the usefulness of various pretext tasks, specifically, rotation, pretext invariant representation learning (PIRL), and deconstruction and construction learning (DCL) for FGVC. Rotation as an auxiliary task promotes the model to learn global features, and diverts it from focusing on the subtle details. PIRL that uses jigsaw patches attempts to focus on discriminative local regions, but struggles to accurately localize them. DCL helps in learning local discriminating features and outperforms the baseline by achieving 87.41% top-1 accuracy. The deconstruction learning forces the model to focus on local object parts, while reconstruction learning helps in learning the correlation between the parts.

        "abstract": "Uncontrolled growth of weeds can severely affect the crop yield and quality. Unrestricted use of herbicide for weed removal alters biodiversity and cause environmental pollution. Instead, identifying weed-infested regions can aid selective chemical treatment of these regions. Advances in analyzing farm images have resulted in solutions to identify weed plants. However, a majority of these approaches are based on supervised learning methods which requires huge amount of manually annotated images. As a result, these supervised approaches are economically infeasible for the individual farmer because of the wide variety of plant species being cultivated. In this paper, we propose a deep learning-based semi-supervised approach for robust estimation of weed density and distribution across farmlands using only limited color images acquired from autonomous robots. This weed density and distribution can be useful in a site-specific weed management system for selective treatment of infected areas using autonomous robots. In this work, the foreground vegetation pixels containing crops and weeds are first identified using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) based unsupervised segmentation. Subsequently, the weed infected regions are identified using a fine-tuned CNN, eliminating the need for designing hand-crafted features. The approach is validated on two datasets of different crop/weed species (1) Crop Weed Field Image Dataset (CWFID), which consists of carrot plant images and the (2) Sugar Beets dataset. The proposed method is able to localize weed-infested regions a maximum recall of 0.99 and estimate weed density with a maximum accuracy of 82.13%. Hence, the proposed approach is shown to generalize to different plant species without the need for extensive labeled data.",

We revisit the task of recovering images under degradation, first introduced over 30 years ago in the Recognition-by-Components theory of human vision. Specifically, we study the performance and behavior of neural networks on the seemingly simple task of classifying regular polygons at varying orders of degradation along their perimeters. To this end, we implement the Automated Shape Recoverability Test1 for rapidly generating large-scale datasets of perimeter-degraded regular polygons, modernizing the historically manual cre- ation of image recoverability experiments. We then investigate the capacity of neural networks to recognize and recover such degraded shapes when initialized with different priors.

The key objective of MR/HD is to localize the moment and estimate clip-wise accordance level, i.e., saliency score, to the given text query. Although the recent transformer-based models brought some advances, we found that these methods do not fully exploit the information of a given query. For example, the relevance between text query and video contents is sometimes neglected when predicting the moment and its saliency. To tackle this issue, we introduce Query-Dependent DETR (QD-DETR), a detection transformer tailored for MR/HD. As we observe the insignificant role of a given query in transformer architec- tures, our encoding module starts with cross-attention layers to explicitly inject the context of text query into video repre- sentation. Then, to enhance the model\u2019s capability of exploit- ing the query information, we manipulate the video-query pairs to produce irrelevant pairs. Such negative (irrelevant) video-query pairs are trained to yield low saliency scores, which in turn, encourages the model to estimate precise ac- cordance between query-video pairs. Lastly, we present an input-adaptive saliency predictor which adaptively defines the criterion of saliency scores for the given video-query pairs. Our extensive studies verify the importance of build- ing the query-dependent representation for MR/HD.

        "abstract": "Recently, the remarkable capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have been illustrated across a variety of research domains such as natural language processing, computer vision, and molecular modeling. We extend this paradigm by utilizing LLMs for material property prediction by introducing our model Materials Informatics Trans- former (MatInFormer). Specifically, we introduce a novel approach that involves learn- ing the grammar of crystallography through the tokenization of pertinent space group information. We further illustrate the adaptability of MatInFormer by incorporating task-specific data pertaining to Metal-Organic Frameworks (MOFs). Through atten- tion visualization, we uncover the key features that the model prioritizes during prop- erty prediction. The effectiveness of our proposed model is empirically validated across\n14 distinct datasets, hereby underscoring its potential for high throughput screening through accurate material property prediction.",

        "title": "LLaVA-Med: Training a Large Language-and-Vision Assistant for Biomedicine in One Day",
        "abstract": "Conversational generative AI has demonstrated remarkable promise for empow- ering biomedical practitioners, but current investigations focus on unimodal text. Multimodal conversational AI has seen rapid progress by leveraging billions of image-text pairs from the public web, but such general-domain vision-language models still lack sophistication in understanding and conversing about biomedical images. In this paper, we propose a cost-efficient approach for training a vision- language conversational assistant that can answer open-ended research questions of biomedical images. The key idea is to leverage a large-scale, broad-coverage biomedical figure-caption dataset extracted from PubMed Central, use GPT-4 to self-instruct open-ended instruction-following data from the captions, and then fine-tune a large general-domain vision-language model using a novel curriculum learning method. Specifically, the model first learns to align biomedical vocabulary using the figure-caption pairs as is, then learns to master open-ended conversational semantics using GPT-4 generated instruction-following data, broadly mimicking how a layperson gradually acquires biomedical knowledge. This enables us to train a Large Language and Vision Assistant for BioMedicine (LLaVA-Med) in less than 15 hours (with eight A100s). LLaVA-Med exhibits excellent multimodal con- versational capability and can follow open-ended instruction to assist with inquiries about a biomedical image. On three standard biomedical visual question answering datasets, fine-tuning LLaVA-Med outperforms previous supervised state-of-the-art on certain metrics. To facilitate biomedical multimodal research, we will release our instruction-following data and the LLaVA-Med model.",

        "title": "Full or Weak annotations?\nAn adaptive strategy for budget-constrained annotation campaigns",
        "abstract": "Annotating new datasets for machine learning tasks is tedious, time-consuming, and costly. For segmentation ap- plications, the burden is particularly high as manual delin- eations of relevant image content are often extremely expen- sive or can only be done by experts with domain-specific knowledge. Thanks to developments in transfer learning and training with weak supervision, segmentation models can now also greatly benefit from annotations of different kinds. However, for any new domain application looking to use weak supervision, the dataset builder still needs to define a strategy to distribute full segmentation and other weak annotations. Doing so is challenging, however, as it is a priori unknown how to distribute an annotation budget for a given new dataset. To this end, we propose a novel ap- proach to determine annotation strategies for segmentation datasets, whereby estimating what proportion of segmen- tation and classification annotations should be collected given a fixed budget. To do so, our method sequentially determines proportions of segmentation and classification annotations to collect for budget-fractions by modeling the expected improvement of the final segmentation model. We show in our experiments that our approach yields annota- tions that perform very close to the optimal for a number of different annotation budgets and datasets.",

Experiments spanning several datasets demonstrate that our new metric achieves the highest correlation with human judgments on both images and videos, outperforming existing reference- based metrics like CIDEr and SPICE and reference-free metrics like CLIP-Score. Finally, we test the system-level correlation of the proposed metric when considering pop- ular image captioning approaches, and assess the impact of employing different cross-modal features.

        "abstract": "Unlike Object Detection, Visual Grounding task necessitates the detection of an object described by complex free-form language. To simultaneously model such complex semantic and visual representations, recent state-of-the-art studies adopt transformer-based models to fuse features from both modalities, further introducing various modules that modulate visual features to align with the language expressions and elim- inate the irrelevant redundant information. However, their loss function, still adopting common Object Detection losses, solely governs the bound- ing box regression output, failing to fully optimize for the above objec- tives. To tackle this problem, in this paper, we first analyze the attention mechanisms of transformer-based models. Building upon this, we further propose a novel framework named Attention-Driven Constraint Balanc- ing (AttBalance) to optimize the behavior of visual features within language-relevant regions. Extensive experimental results show that our method brings impressive improvements. Specifically, we achieve con- stant improvements over five different models evaluated on four different benchmarks. Moreover, we attain a new state-of-the-art performance by integrating our method into QRNet.",

        "abstract": "Although graph neural networks (GNNs) have achieved impressive achievements in graph classi- fication, they often need abundant task-specific la- bels, which could be extensively costly to acquire. A credible solution is to explore additional labeled graphs to enhance unsupervised learning on the target domain. However, how to apply GNNs to domain adaptation remains unsolved owing to the insufficient exploration of graph topology and the significant domain discrepancy. In this paper, we propose Coupled Contrastive Graph Representa- tion Learning (CoCo), which extracts the topolog- ical information from coupled learning branches and reduces the domain discrepancy with cou- pled contrastive learning. CoCo contains a graph convolutional network branch and a hierarchi- cal graph kernel network branch, which explore graph topology in implicit and explicit manners. Besides, we incorporate coupled branches into a holistic multi-view contrastive learning frame- work, which not only incorporates graph repre- sentations learned from complementary views for enhanced understanding, but also encourages the similarity between cross-domain example pairs with the same semantics for domain alignment. Extensive experiments on popular datasets show that our CoCo outperforms these competing base- lines in different settings generally.",

        "abstract": "In this work, we explore neat yet effective Transformer-based frameworks for visual grounding. The previous methods generally address the core problem of visual grounding, i.e., multi-modal fusion and reasoning, with manually-designed mechanisms. Such heuristic designs are not only complicated but also make models easily overfit specific data distributions. To avoid this, we first propose TransVG, which establishes multi-modal correspondences by Transformers and localizes referred regions by directly regressing box coordinates. We empirically show that complicated fusion modules can be replaced by a simple stack of Transformer encoder layers with higher performance. However, the core fusion Transformer in TransVG is stand-alone against uni-modal encoders, and thus should be trained from scratch on limited visual grounding data, which makes it hard to be optimized and leads to sub-optimal performance. To this end, we further introduce TransVG++ to make two-fold improvements. For one thing, we upgrade our framework to a purely Transformer-based one by leveraging Vision Transformer (ViT) for vision feature encoding. For another, we devise Language Conditioned Vision Transformer that removes external fusion modules and reuses the uni-modal ViT for vision-language fusion at the intermediate layers. We conduct extensive experiments on five prevalent datasets, and report a series of state-of-the-art records.",

Specifically, we propose Re-scoring using Image-language Similarity for Few-shot object detection (RISF) which extends Faster R-CNN by introducing Calibration Module using CLIP (CM-CLIP) and Background Negative Re-scale Loss (BNRL). The former adapts CLIP, which performs zero-shot classification, to re-score the classification scores of a detector using image-class similarities, the latter is modified classification loss considering the punishment for fake backgrounds as well as confusing categories on a generalized few-shot object detection dataset.

        "abstract": "A plethora of approaches have been proposed for joint entity-relation (ER)\n extraction. Most of these methods largely depend on a large amount of manually\n annotated training data. However, manual data annotation is time consuming,\n labor intensive, and error prone. Human beings learn using both data (through\n induction) and knowledge (through deduction). Answer Set Programming (ASP) has\n been a widely utilized approach for knowledge representation and reasoning that\n is elaboration tolerant and adept at reasoning with incomplete information.\n This paper proposes a new approach, ASP-enhanced Entity-Relation extraction\n (ASPER), to jointly recognize entities and relations by learning from both data\n and domain knowledge. In particular, ASPER takes advantage of the factual\n knowledge (represented as facts in ASP) and derived knowledge (represented as\n rules in ASP) in the learning process of neural network models. We have\n conducted experiments on two real datasets and compare our method with three\n baselines. The results show that our ASPER model consistently outperforms the\n baselines.",

More formally, given $n$ independent draws from a distribution $p$,\nour algorithm returns a labelled vector whose expected distance from $p$ is\nequal to the minimum possible expected error that could be obtained by any\nalgorithm that knows the true unlabeled vector of probabilities of distribution\n$p$ and simply needs to assign labels, up to an additive subconstant term that\nis independent of $p$ and goes to zero as $n$ gets large. One conceptual\nimplication of this result is that for large samples, Bayesian assumptions on\nthe \"shape\" or bounds on the tail probabilities of a distribution over discrete\nsupport are not helpful for the task of learning the distribution.\nAs a consequence of our techniques, we also show that given a set of $n$\nsamples from an arbitrary distribution, one can accurately estimate the\nexpected number of distinct elements that will be observed in a sample of any\nsize up to $n \\log n$. This sort of extrapolation is practically relevant,\nparticularly to domains such as genomics where it is important to understand\nhow much more might be discovered given larger sample sizes, and we are\noptimistic that our approach is practically viable.",

We found\n that these methods perform well as long as a suitable, problem-dependent\n parameter is chosen. This parameter is used in a threshold which decides\n whether or not to detect an element as a troubled cell. Until now, these\n parameters could not be chosen automatically. The choice of the parameter has\n impact on the approximation: it determines the strictness of the troubled-cell\n indicator. An inappropriate choice of the parameter will result in detection\n (and limiting) of too few or too many elements. The optimal parameter is chosen\n such that the minimal number of troubled cells is detected and the resulting\n approximation is free of spurious oscillations. In this paper we will see that\n for each troubled-cell indicator the sudden increase or decrease of the\n indicator value with respect to the neighboring values is important for\n detection. Indication basically reduces to detecting the outliers of a vector\n (one dimension) or matrix (two dimensions).

The resulting ranks and signs are strictly\ndistribution-free, and maximal invariant under the action of a data-driven\nclass of (order-preserving) transformations generating the family of absolutely\ncontinuous distributions; that property is the theoretical foundation of the\nsemiparametric efficiency preservation property of ranks. The corresponding\nquantiles are equivariant under the same transformations.\nThe empirical proposed distribution functions are defined at observed values\nonly. A continuous extension to the entire $\\mathbb{R}^d$, yielding continuous\nempirical quantile contours while preserving the monotonicity and\nGlivenko-Cantelli features is desirable. Such extension requires solving a\nnontrivial problem of smooth interpolation under cyclical monotonicity\nconstraints. A complete solution of that problem is given in Chapter 2; we show\nthat the resulting distribution and quantile functions are Lipschitz, and\nprovide a sharp lower bound for the Lipschitz constants. A numerical study of\nempirical center-outward quantile contours and their consistency is conducted.",

We perform high resolution\n cosmological magnetohydrodynamics simulations for four distinct halos and\n follow their collapse for a few free-fall times until the simulations reach a\n peak density of $\\rm 7 \\times 10^{-10} g/cm^{3}$. Our findings show that\n irrespective of the initial seed field, the magnetic field strength reaches a\n saturated state in the presence of strong accretion shocks. Under such\n conditions, the growth time becomes very short and amplification occurs rapidly\n within a small fraction of the free-fall time. We find that the presence of\n such strong magnetic fields provides additional support against gravity and\n helps in suppressing fragmentation. Massive clumps of a few hundred solar\n masses are formed at the end of our simulations and high accretion rates of\n $\\rm 1 M_{\\odot}/yr$ are observed. We expect that in the presence of such\n accretion rates, the clumps will grow to form supermassive stars of $\\rm \\sim\n 10^{5} M_{\\odot}$. Overall, the role of the magnetic fields seems supportive\n for the formation of massive black holes.",

        "abstract": "There is a large body of work studying what forms of computational hardness\nare needed to realize classical cryptography. In particular, one-way functions\nand pseudorandom generators can be built from each other, and thus require\nequivalent computational assumptions to be realized. Furthermore, the existence\nof either of these primitives implies that $\\rm{P} \\neq \\rm{NP}$, which gives a\nlower bound on the necessary hardness.\nOne can also define versions of each of these primitives with quantum output:\nrespectively one-way state generators and pseudorandom state generators. Unlike\nin the classical setting, it is not known whether either primitive can be built\nfrom the other. Although it has been shown that pseudorandom state generators\nfor certain parameter regimes can be used to build one-way state generators,\nthe implication has not been previously known in full generality. Furthermore,\nto the best of our knowledge, the existence of one-way state generators has no\nknown implications in complexity theory.\nWe show that pseudorandom states compressing $n$ bits to $\\log n + 1$ qubits\ncan be used to build one-way state generators and pseudorandom states\ncompressing $n$ bits to $\\omega(\\log n)$ qubits are one-way state generators.\nThis is a nearly optimal result since pseudorandom states with fewer than $c\n\\log n$-qubit output can be shown to exist unconditionally. We also show that\nany one-way state generator can be broken by a quantum algorithm with classical\naccess to a $\\rm{PP}$ oracle.\nAn interesting implication of our results is that a $t(n)$-copy one-way state\ngenerator exists unconditionally, for every $t(n) = o(n/\\log n)$. This\ncontrasts nicely with the previously known fact that $O(n)$-copy one-way state\ngenerators require computational hardness.

The nature of a contact,\n whether a point, line, or surface, dictates how these bodies are able to move\n with respect to one another given a force, and a set of contacts can provide\n either partial or full constraint on a body's motion. Decades of work have\n explored how to explicitly estimate the location of a contact and its dynamics,\n e.g., frictional properties, but investigated methods have been computationally\n expensive and there often exists significant uncertainty in the final\n calculation. This has affected further advancements in contact-rich tasks that\n are seemingly simple to humans, such as generalized peg-in-hole insertions.

More formally, contact formations are\n defined according to the constraints imposed on an object's available\n degrees-of-freedom. Rather than estimating individual contact positions, we\n abstract out this calculation to an implicit representation, allowing the robot\n to either acquire, maintain, or release constraints on the object during the\n insertion process, by monitoring forces enacted on the end effector through\n time. Using a compliant robot, our method is desirable in that we are able to\n complete industry-relevant insertion tasks of tolerances <0.25mm without prior\n knowledge of the exact hole location or its orientation.

Therefore,\n improvements are highly needed. In this paper we briefly summarize relevant\n theoretical methods from solid state and surface physics that are able to\n contribute to an improved simulation of plasma-surface interaction in the near\n future. Full \\textit{ab initio} quantum simulations are feasible only for\n extremely short times and/or small system sizes. A substantial simplification\n is achieved when electronic quantum effects are not treated explicitly. Then\n one arrives at semi-classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations for the heavy\n particles that have become the main workhorse in surface science simulations.\n Using microscopically founded potentials and force fields as an input, these MD\n simulations approach the quality of \\textit{ab initio} simulations, in many\n cases. However, despite their simplified nature, these simulations require a\n time step that is of the order or below one femtosecond making it prohibitive\n to reach experimentally relevant scales of minutes. To bridge this gap in\n length and time scales without compromising the first principles character of\n the simulations, many physical and computational strategies have been put\n forward in surface science. This paper presents a brief overview on different\n methods and their underlying physical ideas, and we compare their strengths and\n weaknesses.",

        "abstract": "The cosmic distance duality (CDD) relation (based on the Etherington\n reciprocity theorem) plays a crucial role in a wide assortment of cosmological\n measurements. Attempts at confirming it observationally have met with mixed\n results, though the general consensus appears to be that the data do support\n its existence in nature. A common limitation with past approaches has been\n their reliance on a specific cosmological model, or on measurements of the\n luminosity distance to Type Ia SNe, which introduces a dependence on the\n presumed cosmology in spite of beliefs to the contrary. Confirming that the CDD\n is actually realized in nature is crucial because its violation would require\n exotic new physics. In this paper, we study the CDD using the observed angular\n size of compact quasar cores and a Gaussian Process reconstruction of the HII\n galaxy Hubble diagram---without pre-assuming any particular background\n cosmology. In so doing, we confirm at a very high level of confidence that the\n angular-diameter and luminosity distances do indeed satisfy the CDD. We then\n demonstrate the potential power of this result by utilizing it in a comparative\n test of two competing cosmological models---the R_h=ct universe and LCDM---and\n show that R_h=ct is favoured by the CDD data with a likelihood ~82.3% compared\n with ~17.7% for the standard model.",

We argue\n that, in a broad class of models for the joint distribution of positions and\n velocities, this narrowing generates an entropic force that opposes the\n cohesion of the flock. The strength of this force depends strongly on the\n nature of the interactions among birds: if birds are coupled to a fixed number\n of neighbors, the entropic forces are weak, while if they couple to all other\n birds within a fixed distance, the entropic forces are sufficient to tear a\n flock apart. Similar entropic forces should occur in other non-equilibrium\n systems.

Meanwhile, multispectral images (MSI), e.g., RGB images, have a high\n spatial resolution but deficient spectral signatures. Hyperspectral and\n multispectral image fusion can be cost-effective and efficient for acquiring\n both high spatial resolution and high spectral resolution images. Many of the\n conventional HSI and MSI fusion algorithms rely on known spatial degradation\n parameters, i.e., point spread function, spectral degradation parameters,\n spectral response function, or both of them. Another class of deep\n learning-based models relies on the ground truth of high spatial resolution HSI\n and needs large amounts of paired training images when working in a supervised\n manner.

Statistically easy to learn linear\n system classes have sample complexity that is polynomial with the system\n dimension. Most prior research in the finite sample regime falls in this\n category, focusing on systems that are directly excited by process noise.\n Statistically hard to learn linear system classes have worst-case sample\n complexity that is at least exponential with the system dimension, regardless\n of the identification algorithm. Using tools from minimax theory, we show that\n classes of linear systems can be hard to learn.

Having classified some systems as easy or hard to learn, a natural\n question arises as to what system properties fundamentally affect the hardness\n of system identifiability. Towards this direction, we characterize how the\n controllability index of linear systems affects the sample complexity of\n identification.

To further reveal the temporal and spatial behaviors of the CMEs\n at different latitudes and heights, we analyzed the correlation and phase\n relationships between the occurrence rate of CMEs, the Coronal Brightness Index\n (CBI), and the 10.7-cm solar radio flux (F10.7). We found that the occurrence\n rate of the CMEs correlates with CBI relatively stronger at high latitudes\n (>=60) than at low latitudes (<=50). At low latitudes, the occurrence rate of\n the CMEs correlates relatively weaker with CBI than F10.7. There is a\n relatively stronger correlation relationship between CMEs, F10.7, and CBI\n during Solar Cycle 24(SC24) than Solar Cycle 23 (SC23).

Prior theoretical works on adversarial\n attacks against RL mainly focus on either observation poisoning attacks or\n environment poisoning attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new class of\n attacks named action poisoning attacks, where an adversary can change the\n action signal selected by the agent. Compared with existing attack models, the\n attacker's ability in the proposed action poisoning attack model is more\n restricted, which brings some design challenges. We study the action poisoning\n attack in both white-box and black-box settings. We introduce an adaptive\n attack scheme called LCB-H, which works for most RL agents in the black-box\n setting. We prove that the LCB-H attack can force any efficient RL agent, whose\n dynamic regret scales sublinearly with the total number of steps taken, to\n choose actions according to a policy selected by the attacker very frequently,\n with only sublinear cost. In addition, we apply LCB-H attack against a popular\n model-free RL algorithm: UCB-H. We show that, even in the black-box setting, by\n spending only logarithm cost, the proposed LCB-H attack scheme can force the\n UCB-H agent to choose actions according to the policy selected by the attacker\n very frequently.",

However, FPVs suffer from\n extremely low photocurrents, which is primarily due to their wide band gaps.\n Here, we present a new class of FPVs by demonstrating switchable ferroelectric\n photovoltaic effects using hexagonal ferrite (h-RFeO3) thin films having narrow\n band gaps of ~1.2 eV, where R denotes rare-earth ions. FPVs with narrow band\n gaps suggests their potential applicability as photovoltaic and optoelectronic\n devices. The h-RFeO3 films further exhibit reasonably large ferroelectric\n polarizations, which possibly reduces a rapid recombination rate of the\n photo-generated electron-hole pairs. The power conversion efficiency (PCE) of\n h-RFeO3 thin-film devices is sensitive on the magnitude of polarization. In the\n case of h-TmFeO3 (h-TFO) thin film, the measured PCE is twice as large as that\n of the BiFeO3 thin film, a prototypic FPV. We have further shown that the\n switchable photovoltaic effect dominates over the unswitchable internal field\n effect arising from the net built-in potential.

        "abstract": "This paper showed how a simple lumped parameter model of a circuit can yield\n correct quantum mechanical predictions of its behavior, even when there is\n quantum entanglement between components of that circuit. It addresses an\n important example, the circuit of the original Bell's Theorem experiments for\n ideal polarizers. Correct predictions emerge from two alternative simple but\n time-symmetric models based on classical Markov Random Field across space time.\n Exact agreement here does not violate Bell's Theorem itself, because the\n interplay between initial and final outcomes in these calculations does not\n fall within the CHSH definition of time forwards causality. Both models raise\n interesting questions for future research. The final section discusses several\n possible directions for following up on these results, both in lumped system\n modeling and in more general approaches. The final section proposed a new\n experiment with three-photon entanglement which could tell us which is true,\n local realistic MRF models and time-symmetric physics, or conventional\n predictions assuming the usual collapse of the wave function. The appendix\n worked out what the conventional predictions would be for the proposed\n experiment, and also gives a simple master equation version of the collapse\n assumption which does not involve metaphysical observers.

It is a\ncombinatory calculus containing a special combinator, F, which is able to\nexamine the internal structure of its first argument. The calculus is\nsignificant in that as well as being combinatorially complete it also exhibits\nthe property of structural completeness, i.e. it is able to represent any\nfunction on terms definable using pattern matching on arbitrary normal forms.\nIn particular, it admits a term that can decide the structural equality of any\ntwo arbitrary normal forms.\nSince SF-calculus is combinatorially complete, it is clearly at least as\npowerful as the more familiar and paradigmatic Turing-powerful computational\nmodels of Lambda Calculus and Combinatory Logic. Its relationship to these\nmodels in the converse direction is less obvious, however. Jay and Given-Wilson\nhave suggested that SF-calculus is strictly more powerful than the\naforementioned models, but a detailed study of the connections between these\nmodels is yet to be undertaken.\nThis paper begins to bridge that gap by presenting a faithful encoding of the\nFactorisation Calculus into the Lambda Calculus preserving both reduction and\nstrong normalisation. The existence of such an encoding is a new result. It\nalso suggests that there is, in some sense, an equivalence between the former\nmodel and the latter.

        "abstract": "We investigated the effect of material choice and orientation in limiting\n source to drain tunneling (SDT) in nanowire (NW) p-MOSFETs. Si, Ge, GaSb, and\n Ge0.96Sn0.04 nanowire MOSFETs (NWFETs) were simulated using rigorous ballistic\n quantum transport simulations. To properly account for the non-parabolicity and\n anisotropy of the valence band the k.p method was used. For each material, a\n set of six different transport/confinement directions were simulated to\n identify the direction with the highest ON-current (ION ). For Ge, GaSb, and\n GeSn [001]/110/-110 oriented NWFETs showed the best ON-state performance,\n compared to other orientations. Our simulation results show that, despite\n having a higher percentage of SDT in OFF-state than silicon, GaSb\n [001]/110/-110 NWFET can outperform Si NWFETs. We further examined the role of\n doping in limiting SDT and demonstrated that the ON-state performance of Ge and\n GeSn NWFETs could be improved by reducing the doping in the source/drain (S/D)\n extension regions. Finally, we analyzed the impact of increased injection\n velocity in [ [001]/110/-110 oriented GaSb and GeSn NWFETs, as a result of the\n application of uniaxial compressive stress, and showed that when compared at a\n fixed OFF-current (IOFF) with unstrained NWFETs, uniaxial compressive stress\n deteriorates the ON-state performancedue to an increase in OFF-state SDT\n current component.",

Despite its success, the\n behavior and robustness of deep networks are not fully understood yet, posing a\n significant risk. In particular, researchers recently found that neural\n networks are overly confident in their predictions, even on data they have\n never seen before. To tackle this issue, one can differentiate two approaches\n in the literature. One accounts for uncertainty in the predictions, while the\n second estimates the underlying density of the training data to decide whether\n a given input is close to the training data, and thus the network is able to\n perform as expected.In this thesis, we investigate the capabilities of EBMs at\n the task of fitting the training data distribution to perform detection of\n out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We find that on most datasets, EBMs do not\n inherently outperform other density estimators at detecting OOD data despite\n their flexibility. Thus, we additionally investigate the effects of\n supervision, dimensionality reduction, and architectural modifications on the\n performance of EBMs. Further, we propose Energy-Prior Network (EPN) which\n enables estimation of various uncertainties within an EBM for classification,\n bridging the gap between two approaches for tackling the OOD detection problem.\n We identify a connection between the concentration parameters of the Dirichlet\n distribution and the joint energy in an EBM. Additionally, this allows\n optimization without a held-out OOD dataset, which might not be available or\n costly to collect in some applications. Finally, we empirically demonstrate\n that Energy-Prior Network (EPN) is able to detect OOD inputs, datasets shifts,\n and adversarial examples.

        "abstract": "Let $X_1,\\dots,X_n$ be independent nonnegative random variables (r.v.'s),\n with $S_n:=X_1+\\dots+X_n$ and finite values of $s_i:=E X_i^2$ and $m_i:=E\n X_i>0$. Exact upper bounds on $E f(S_n)$ for all functions $f$ in a certain\n class $\\mathcal{F}$ of nonincreasing functions are obtained, in each of the\n following settings: (i) $n,m_1,\\dots,m_n,s_1,\\dots,s_n$ are fixed; (ii) $n$,\n $m:=m_1+\\dots+m_n$, and $s:=s_1+\\dots+s_n$ are fixed; (iii)~only $m$ and $s$\n are fixed. These upper bounds are of the form $E f(\\eta)$ for a certain r.v.\n $\\eta$. The r.v. $\\eta$ and the class $\\mathcal{F}$ depend on the choice of one\n of the three settings. In particular, $(m/s)\\eta$ has the binomial distribution\n with parameters $n$ and $p:=m^2/(ns)$ in setting (ii) and the Poisson\n distribution with parameter $\\lambda:=m^2/s$ in setting (iii). One can also let\n $\\eta$ have the normal distribution with mean $m$ and variance $s$ in any of\n these three settings. In each of the settings, the class $\\mathcal{F}$\n contains, and is much wider than, the class of all decreasing exponential\n functions. As corollaries of these results, optimal in a certain sense upper\n bounds on the left-tail probabilities $P(S_n\\le x)$ are presented, for any real\n $x$.

        "abstract": "Sensitivity to severe occlusion and large view angles limits the usage\n scenarios of the existing monocular 3D dense face alignment methods. The\n state-of-the-art 3DMM-based method, directly regresses the model's\n coefficients, underutilizing the low-level 2D spatial and semantic information,\n which can actually offer cues for face shape and orientation. In this work, we\n demonstrate how modeling 3D facial geometry in image and model space jointly\n can solve the occlusion and view angle problems. Instead of predicting the\n whole face directly, we regress image space features in the visible facial\n region by dense prediction first. Subsequently, we predict our model's\n coefficients based on the regressed feature of the visible regions, leveraging\n the prior knowledge of whole face geometry from the morphable models to\n complete the invisible regions. We further propose a fusion network that\n combines the advantages of both the image and model space predictions to\n achieve high robustness and accuracy in unconstrained scenarios. Thanks to the\n proposed fusion module, our method is robust not only to occlusion and large\n pitch and roll view angles, which is the benefit of our image space approach,\n but also to noise and large yaw angles, which is the benefit of our model space\n method. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of our\n method compared with the state-of-the-art methods. On the 3D dense face\n alignment task, we achieve 3.80% NME on the AFLW2000-3D dataset, which\n outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 5.5%.

The viscous perturbation equations\n are then combined in terms of the vorticity and velocity, and are solved by\n means of a combined Laplace-Fourier transform in the plane normal to the basic\n flow. This treatment allows for a simplification of the governing equations\n such that it is possible to observe long transients, that can last hundreds\n time scales. This result would not be possible over an acceptable lapse of time\n by carrying out a direct numerical integration of the linearized Navier-Stokes\n equations. The exploration is done with respect to physical inputs as the angle\n of obliquity, the symmetry of the perturbation and the streamwise damping rate.\n The base flow is an intermediate section of the growing 2D circular cylinder\n wake where the entrainment process is still active. Two Reynolds numbers of the\n order of the critical value for the onset of the first instability are\n considered. The early transient evolution offers very different scenarios for\n which we present a summary for particular cases.

Despite their\nsimplicity, the ability of these systems to accurately represent thermodynamics\n(specifically to satisfy the second law) and whether or not they display\nLandauer Erasure, has been a matter of ongoing argument. The recent\nNorton-Ladyman controversy is one such example.\nIn this paper we introduce a programming language to describe these simple\nthermodynamic processes, and give a formal operational semantics and program\nlogic as a basis for formal reasoning about thermodynamic systems. We formalise\nthe basic single-particle operations as statements in the language, and then\nshow that the second law must be satisfied by any composition of these basic\noperations. This is done by finding a computational invariant of the system. We\nshow, furthermore, that this invariant requires an erasure cost to exist within\nthe system, equal to kTln2 for a bit of information: Landauer Erasure becomes a\ntheorem of the formal system. The Norton-Ladyman controversy can therefore be\nresolved in a rigorous fashion, and moreover the formalism we introduce gives a\nset of reasoning tools for further analysis of Landauer erasure, which are\nprovably consistent with the second law of thermodynamics.",

        "title": "Connecting transonic buffet with incompressible low-frequency\noscillations on aerofoils",
        "abstract": "Self-sustained low-frequency flow unsteadiness over rigid aerofoils in the\n transonic regime is referred to as transonic buffet. Although the exact\n physical mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are unclear, it is generally\n assumed to be unique to the transonic regime. This assumption is shown to be\n incorrect here by performing large-eddy simulations of flow over a NACA0012\n profile for a wide range of flow conditions. At zero incidence and sufficiently\n high freestream Mach numbers, M, transonic buffet occurs with shock waves\n present in the flow. However, self-sustained oscillations that occur at similar\n frequencies are observed at lower M for which shock waves are absent and the\n entire flow field remains subsonic at all times. At higher incidences, the\n oscillations are sustained at progressively lower M. Oscillations were observed\n for M as low as 0.3, where compressibility effects are small. A spectral proper\n orthogonal decomposition shows that the spatial structure of these oscillations\n (i.e., mode shapes) are essentially the same for all cases. These results\n indicate that buffet on aerofoils does not necessarily require the presence of\n shock waves. Furthermore, the trend seen with increasing incidence angles\n suggests that transonic buffet on aerofoils and low-frequency oscillations\n reported in the incompressible regime (Zaman et al., 1989, J. Fluid Mech., vol.\n 202, pp. 403--442) have similar origins. Thus, models which rely specifically\n on shock waves to explain transonic buffet are incorrect. These insights could\n be useful in understanding the origins of ``transonic\" buffet and reformulating\n mitigation strategies by shifting the focus away from shock waves.",

This review included 57 full-text studies that\n reported the use of GANs for different applications in COVID-19 lungs images\n data. Most of the studies (n=42) used GANs for data augmentation to enhance the\n performance of AI techniques for COVID-19 diagnosis.

For majority of the studies (n=47),\n the experiments were done and results were reported using publicly available\n data.

Aims: To complement the studies\nof dynamics, we therefore aim to understand how new asymmetries are created by\nthe addition of collisional evolution and drag forces, and existing ones\nstrengthened or overridden. Methods: We augmented our existing numerical code\n\"Analysis of Collisional Evolution\" (ACE) by an azimuthal dimension, the\nlongitude of periapse. A set of fiducial discs with global eccentricities\nranging from 0 to 0.4 is evolved over giga-year timescales. Size distribution\nand spatial variation of dust are analysed and interpreted. The basic impact of\nbelt eccentricity on spectral energy distributions (SEDs) and images is\ndiscussed.\nResults: We find features imposed on characteristic timescales. First,\nradiation pressure defines size cutoffs that differ between periapse and\napoapse, resulting in an asymmetric halo. The differences in size distribution\nmake the observable asymmetry of the halo depend on wavelength. Second,\ncollisional equilibrium prefers smaller grains on the apastron side of the\nparent belt, reducing the effect of pericentre glow and the overall asymmetry.\nThird, Poynting-Robertson drag fills the region interior to an eccentric belt\nsuch that the apastron side is more tenuous.

We show that they emerge from the\n underlying algebro-topological identities known as the twisted period\n relations. In order to do so, we formulate tree-level string theory amplitudes\n in the language of twisted de Rham theory. There, open string amplitudes are\n understood as pairings between twisted cycles and cocycles. Similarly, closed\n string amplitudes are given as a pairing between two twisted cocycles. Finally,\n objects relating the two types of string amplitudes are the $\\alpha'$-corrected\n bi-adjoint scalar amplitudes recently defined by the author [arXiv:1610.04230].\n We show that they naturally arise as intersection numbers of twisted cycles. In\n this work we focus on the combinatorial and topological description of twisted\n cycles relevant for string theory amplitudes. In this setting, each twisted\n cycle is a polytope, known in combinatorics as the associahedron, together with\n an additional structure encoding monodromy properties of string integrals. In\n fact, this additional structure is given by higher-dimensional generalizations\n of the Pochhammer contour. An open string amplitude is then computed as an\n integral of a logarithmic form over an associahedron. We show that the inverse\n of the KLT kernel can be calculated from the knowledge of how pairs of\n associahedra intersect one another in the moduli space.

While some explanations of such\n non-normal transient growth of disturbances in the Rayleigh stable limit were\n available for magnetized accretion flows, similar instabilities in absence of\n magnetic perturbations remained unexplained. This dichotomy was resolved in two\n recent publications by Chattopadhyay, {\\it et al} where it was shown that such\n instabilities, especially for non-magnetized accretion flows, were introduced\n through interaction of the inherent stochastic noise in the system (even a\n \\enquote{cold} accretion flow at 3000K is too \\enquote{hot} in the statistical\n parlance and is capable of inducing strong thermal modes) with the underlying\n Taylor-Couette flow profiles. Both studies, however, excluded the additional\n energy influx (or efflux) that could result from nonzero cross-correlation of a\n noise perturbing the velocity flow, say, with the noise that is driving the\n vorticity flow (or equivalently the magnetic field and magnetic vorticity flow\n dynamics). In this article we show that nonzero noise cross-correlations\n essentially renormalize the strength of temporal correlations. Apart from an\n overall boost in the energy rate (both for spatial and temporal correlations,\n and hence in the ensemble averaged energy spectra), this results in mutual\n competition in growth rates of affected variables often resulting in\n suppression of oscillating Alfven waves at small times while leading to faster\n saturations at relatively longer time scales.

        "abstract": "Recent advances in saliency detection have utilized deep learning to obtain\n high level features to detect salient regions in a scene. These advances have\n demonstrated superior results over previous works that utilize hand-crafted low\n level features for saliency detection. In this paper, we demonstrate that\n hand-crafted features can provide complementary information to enhance\n performance of saliency detection that utilizes only high level features. Our\n method utilizes both high level and low level features for saliency detection\n under a unified deep learning framework. The high level features are extracted\n using the VGG-net, and the low level features are compared with other parts of\n an image to form a low level distance map. The low level distance map is then\n encoded using a convolutional neural network(CNN) with multiple 1X1\n convolutional and ReLU layers. We concatenate the encoded low level distance\n map and the high level features, and connect them to a fully connected neural\n network classifier to evaluate the saliency of a query region. Our experiments\n show that our method can further improve the performance of state-of-the-art\n deep learning-based saliency detection methods.",

In this work, we theoretically investigate the moire band structures\n of the DTFLGs with diverse arrangements of MLG and BLG. We find that, depending\n on the relative rotation direction of the two twist angles (alternate or chiral\n twist) and the middle van der Waals (vdW) layer (MLG or BLG), a general\n (X+Y+Z)-DTFLG can be classified into four categories, i.e. (X+1+Z)-ATFLG,\n (X+2+Z)-ATFLG, (X+1+Z)-CTFLG and (X+2+Z)-CTFLG, each of which has its own\n unique band structure.

A number of studies, aimed at its experimental verification, have found\n adequate supportive evidence in its favour. Theoretical investigations,\n however, have been few, perhaps because formulating a population-genetic model\n for describing the Trivers-Willard hypothesis turns out to be surprisingly\n complex. The present study describes a minimal population genetic model to\n explore one specific scenario, viz. how is the preference for a male offspring\n by females in good condition altered when 'g', the proportion of such females\n in the population changes from a low to a high value. As expected, when the\n proportion of such females is low, i.e., for low values of 'g', the\n Trivers-Willard (TW) strategy goes to fixation against the equal investment\n strategy. This holds true up to gmax, a critical value of 'g', above which the\n two strategies coexist, but the proportion of the TW strategy steadily\n decreases as 'g' increases to unity. Similarly, when the effect of well-endowed\n males attaining disproportionately high number of matings is more pronounced,\n the TW strategy is more likely to go to fixation. Interestingly, the success of\n the TW strategy has a complex dependence on the variance in the physiological\n condition of females. If the difference in the two types of conditions is not\n large, TW strategy is favoured, and its success is more likely as the\n difference increases.

Our analysis of such iris templates\n also indicates significant degradation and reduction in the region of interest,\n where the iris recognition can benefit from a similarity distance that can\n consider importance of different binary bits, instead of the direct use of\n Hamming distance in the literature. Periocular information can be dynamically\n reinforced, by incorporating the differences in the effective area of available\n iris regions, for more accurate iris recognition. This paper presents such a\n segmentation-assisted adaptive framework for more accurate less-constrained\n iris recognition. The effectiveness of this framework is evaluated on three\n publicly available iris databases using within-dataset and cross-dataset\n performance evaluation and validates the merit of the proposed iris recognition\n framework.",

We explain these empirical findings by formalizing the relation between the balanced and imbalanced regression losses. Finally, we show that our findings hold on two real imbalanced image datasets for depth estimation (NYUD2- DIR), and age estimation (IMDB-WIKI-DIR), and on the problem of imbalanced video progress prediction (Break-fast). Our main takeaway is: for a regression task, if the data sampling is imbalanced, then add a classification loss.",

        "abstract": "Realistic human-centric rendering plays a key role in both computer vision and computer graphics. Rapid progress has been made in the algorithm aspect over the years, yet existing human-centric rendering datasets and benchmarks are rather impoverished in terms of diversity (e.g., outfit\u2019s fabric/material, body\u2019s interaction with ob- jects, and motion sequences), which are crucial for render- ing effect. Researchers are usually constrained to explore and evaluate a small set of rendering problems on current datasets, while real-world applications require meth- ods to be robust across different scenarios. In this work, we present DNA-Rendering, a large-scale, high-fidelity reposi- tory of human performance data for neural actor rendering. DNA-Rendering presents several alluring attributes. First, our dataset contains over 1500 human subjects, 5000 mo- tion sequences, and 67.5M frames\u2019 data volume. Upon the massive collections, we provide human subjects with grand categories of pose actions, body shapes, clothing, acces- sories, hairdos, and object intersection, which ranges the geometry and appearance variances from everyday life to professional occasions. Second, we provide rich assets for each subject \u2013 2D/3D human body keypoints, foreground masks, SMPLX models, cloth/accessory materials, multi- view images, and videos. These assets boost the current method\u2019s accuracy on downstream rendering tasks. Third, we construct a professional multi-view system to capture data, which contains 60 synchronous cameras with max 4096 \u00d7 3000 resolution, 15 fps speed, and stern camera calibration steps, ensuring high-quality resources for task training and evaluation.\nAlong with the dataset, we provide a large-scale and quantitative benchmark in full-scale, with multiple tasks to evaluate the existing progress of novel view synthesis, novel pose animation synthesis, and novel identity render- ing methods. In this manuscript, we describe our DNA- Rendering effort as a revealing of new observations, chal- lenges, and future directions to human-centric rendering.

Existing large-scale 3D perception datasets often contain data that are meticu- lously cleaned. Such configurations, however, cannot reflect the reliability of perception models during the deployment stage. In this work, we present Robo3D, the first compre- hensive benchmark heading toward probing the robustness of 3D detectors and segmentors under out-of-distribution scenarios against natural corruptions that occur in real- world environments. Specifically, we consider eight corrup- tion types stemming from severe weather conditions, exter- nal disturbances, and internal sensor failure. We uncover that, although promising results have been progressively achieved on standard benchmarks, state-of-the-art 3D per- ception models are at risk of being vulnerable to corrup- tions. We draw key observations on the use of data represen- tations, augmentation schemes, and training strategies, that could severely affect the model\u2019s performance. To pursue better robustness, we propose a density-insensitive training framework along with a simple flexible voxelization strat- egy to enhance the model resiliency.

        "abstract": "Visual similarity discovery (VSD) is an important task with broad e-commerce applications. Given an image of a certain object, the goal of VSD is to retrieve images of different objects with high perceptual visual similarity. Al- though being a highly addressed problem, the evaluation of proposed methods for VSD is often based on a proxy of an identification-retrieval task, evaluating the ability of a model to retrieve different images of the same object. We posit that evaluating VSD methods based on identification tasks is limited, and faithful evaluation must rely on expert annotations. In this paper, we introduce the first large-scale fashion visual similarity benchmark dataset, consisting of more than 110K expert-annotated image pairs. Besides this major contribution, we share insight from the challenges we faced while curating this dataset. Based on these insights, we propose a novel and efficient labeling procedure that can be applied to any dataset. Our analysis examines its limita- tions and inductive biases, and based on these findings, we propose metrics to mitigate those limitations. Though our primary focus lies on visual similarity, the methodologies we present have broader applications for discovering and evaluating perceptual similarity across various domains.",

In natural language, in order to specify a partic- ular object or set of objects of interest, humans use deter- miners such as \u201cmy\u201d, \u201ceither\u201d and \u201cthose\u201d. Determiners, as an important word class, are a type of schema in nat- ural language about the reference or quantity of the noun. Existing grounded referencing datasets place much less em- phasis on determiners, compared to other word classes such as nouns, verbs and adjectives. This makes it difficult to de- velop models that understand the full variety and complex-ity of object referencing. Thus, we have developed and re- leased the DetermiNet dataset 1, which comprises 250,000 synthetically generated images and captions based on 25 determiners. The task is to predict bounding boxes to iden- tify objects of interest, constrained by the semantics of the given determiner.

It requires machines to reason out affordances and simultaneously give the reason: what attributes make an object possess these affordances. To support OCL, we build a densely annotated knowledge base including extensive annotations for three levels of ob- ject concept (category, attribute, affordance), and the clear causal relations of three levels. By analyzing the causal structure of OCL, we present a baseline, Object Concept Reasoning Network (OCRN). It leverages concept instanti- ation and causal intervention to infer the three levels.

However, existing benchmarks heavily rely on subjec- tive human evaluation, limiting their ability to holistically as- sess the model\u2019s capabilities. Furthermore, there is a signifi- cant gap between efforts in developing new T2I architectures and those in evaluation. To address this, we introduce HRS-Bench, a concrete evaluation benchmark for T2I models that is Holistic, Reliable, and Scalable. Unlike existing bench- marks that focus on limited aspects, HRS-Bench measures 13 skills that can be categorized into five major categories: accuracy, robustness, generalization, fairness, and bias. In addition, HRS-Bench covers 50 scenarios, including fash- ion, animals, transportation, food, and clothes. We evaluate nine recent large-scale T2I models using metrics that cover a wide range of skills. A human evaluation aligned with 95% of our evaluations on average was conducted to probe the effectiveness of HRS-Bench. Our experiments demon- strate that existing models often struggle to generate images with the desired count of objects, visual text, or grounded emotions.

As a step toward developing AI to aid in student learning as intelligent teacher assis- tants, we introduce the Multimodal Lecture Presentations dataset as a large-scale benchmark testing the capabilities of machine learning models in multimodal un- derstanding of educational content. Our dataset contains aligned slides and spoken language, for 180+ hours of video and 9000+ slides, with 10 lecturers from various subjects (e.g., computer science, dentistry, biology).

We provide manual annotations to help implement these two research tasks and evaluate state- of-the-art models on them. Comparing baselines and human student performances,\nwe find that current models struggle in (1) weak crossmodal alignment between slides and spoken text, (2) learning novel visual mediums, (3) technical language, and (4) long-range sequences. Towards addressing this issue, we also introduce PolyViLT, a multimodal transformer trained with a multi-instance learning loss that is more effective than current approaches.

        "abstract": "Visual mathematical reasoning, as a fundamental visual reasoning ability, has\nreceived widespread attention from the Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) community. Existing benchmarks focus more on the result-oriented performance,\nbut neglecting the underlying principles in knowledge acquisition and generalization. Inspired by human-like mathematical reasoning, we introduce WE-MATH,\nthe first benchmark specifically designed to explore the problem-solving principles beyond the end-to-end performance. We meticulously collect and categorize\n6.5K visual math problems, spanning 67 hierarchical knowledge concepts and\n5 layers of knowledge granularity. We firstly decompose composite problems\ninto sub-problems according to the required knowledge concepts and introduce a\nnovel four-dimensional metric, namely Insufficient Knowledge (IK), Inadequate\nGeneralization (IG), Complete Mastery (CM), and Rote Memorization (RM) to hierarchically assess inherent issues in LMMs\u2019 reasoning process. With WE-MATH,\nwe conduct a thorough evaluation of existing LMMs in visual mathematical reasoning and reveal a negative correlation between solving step and problem-specific\nperformance. We confirm the IK issue of LMMs can be effectively improved\nvia knowledge augmentation strategy. More notably, the primary challenge of\nGPT-4o has significantly transitioned from IK to IG, establishing it as the first\nLMM advancing towards the knowledge generalization stage. In contrast, other\nLMMs exhibit a marked inclination towards Rote Memorization \u2013 they correctly\nsolve composite problems involving multiple knowledge concepts, yet fail in answering sub-problems. We anticipate that WE-MATH will open new pathways for\nadvancements in visual mathematical reasoning for LMMs. The WE-MATH data\nand evaluation code are available at https://github.com/We-Math/We-Math.",

However, their abilities on long-context DU remain an open\nproblem. This work presents MMLONGBENCH-DOC, a long-context, multimodal benchmark comprising 1,062 expert-annotated questions. Distinct from\nprevious datasets, it is constructed upon 130 lengthy PDF-formatted documents\nwith an average of 49.4 pages and 20,971 textual tokens. Towards comprehensive\nevaluation, answers to these questions rely on pieces of evidence from (1) different\nsources (text, image, chart, table, and layout structure) and (2) various locations\n(i.e., page number). Moreover, 33.2% of the questions are cross-page questions\nrequiring evidence across multiple pages. 22.8% of the questions are designed to\nbe unanswerable for detecting potential hallucinations. Experiments on 14 LVLMs\ndemonstrate that long-context DU greatly challenges current models.

Furthermore, 12 LVLMs (all except GPT-4o\nand GPT-4V) even present worse performance than their LLM counterparts which\nare fed with lossy-parsed OCR documents.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in natural language\nprocessing tasks. In the AIOps domain, they excel in tasks such as anomaly detection, root cause analysis of faults, operations and\nmaintenance script generation, and alert information summarization. However, the performance of current LLMs in log analysis tasks\nremains inadequately validated. To address this gap, we introduce LogEval, a comprehensive benchmark suite designed to evaluate\nthe capabilities of LLMs in various log analysis tasks for the first time. This benchmark covers tasks such as log parsing, log anomaly\ndetection, log fault diagnosis, and log summarization. LogEval evaluates each task using 4,000 publicly available log data entries and\nemploys 15 different prompts for each task to ensure a thorough and fair assessment. By rigorously evaluating leading LLMs, we\ndemonstrate the impact of various LLM technologies on log analysis performance, focusing on aspects such as self-consistency and\nfew-shot contextual learning. We also discuss findings related to model quantification, Chinese-English question-answering evaluation,\nand prompt engineering. These findings provide insights into the strengths and weaknesses of LLMs in multilingual environments and the effectiveness of different prompt strategies. Various evaluation methods are employed for different tasks to accurately measure the\nperformance of LLMs in log analysis, ensuring a comprehensive assessment. The insights gained from LogEval\u2019s evaluation reveal the\nstrengths and limitations of LLMs in log analysis tasks, providing valuable guidance for researchers and practitioners. Key findings\nindicate that while LLMs show promise in certain areas, there are notable challenges in handling complex log data and maintaining\nhigh accuracy across diverse tasks. LogEval is poised to significantly advance the application and development of LLMs in log analysis,\noffering effective solutions for practical log analysis challenges.

        "abstract": "The rapid increase in user-generated content (UGC) videos calls for the development of effective video qual- ity assessment (VQA) algorithms. However, the objective of the UGC-VQA problem is still ambiguous and can be viewed from two perspectives: the technical perspective, measuring the perception of distortions; and the aesthetic perspective, which relates to preference and recommenda- tion on contents. To understand how these two perspectives affect overall subjective opinions in UGC-VQA, we con- duct a large-scale subjective study to collect human quality opinions on the overall quality of videos as well as percep- tions from aesthetic and technical perspectives. The col- lected Disentangled Video Quality Database (DIVIDE-3k)\nconfirms that human quality opinions on UGC videos are universally and inevitably affected by both aesthetic and technical perspectives.

The DOVER proves state-of-the-art performance in UGC-VQA under very high efficiency. With perspective opinions in DIVIDE-3k, we further propose DOVER++, the first approach to provide reliable clear-cut quality evalua- tions from a single aesthetic or technical perspective.

H3WB comprises 133 whole-body keypoint anno-\ntations on 100K images, made possible by our new multi- view pipeline.

To verify this, we create ImageNet-AB and COCO-AB.

We refer to the new paradigm of training models with annota- tion byproducts as learning using annotation byproducts (LUAB).

How- ever, since the target objects in these existing datasets are usually relatively salient, dominant, and isolated, VOS under complex scenes has rarely been studied. To revisit VOS and make it more applicable in the real world, we collect a new VOS dataset called coMplex video Object SEgmentation (MOSE) to study the tracking and segmenting objects in complex environments. MOSE contains 2,149 video clips and 5,200 objects from 36 categories, with 431,725 high-quality object segmentation masks. The most notable feature of MOSE dataset is complex scenes with crowded and occluded objects. The target objects in the videos are commonly occluded by others and disappear in some frames. To analyze the proposed MOSE dataset, we benchmark 18 existing VOS methods under 4 differ- ent settings on the proposed MOSE dataset and conduct comprehensive comparisons. The experiments show that current VOS algorithms cannot well perceive objects in complex scenes. For example, under the semi-supervised VOS setting, the highest \ue236 &\ue232 by existing state-of-the-art VOS methods is only 59.4% on MOSE, much lower than their \u223c90% \ue236 &\ue232 performance on DAVIS.

Moreover, OxfordTVG-HIC is curated devoid of offensive content. We also show how OxfordTVG- HIC can be leveraged for evaluating the humour of a gen- erated text. Through explainability analysis of the trained models, we identify the visual and linguistic cues influen- tial for evoking humour prediction (and generation). We observe qualitatively that these cues are aligned with the benign violation theory of humour in cognitive psychology.",

        "abstract": "The progress in maritime obstacle detection is hindered by the lack of a diverse dataset that adequately captures the complexity of general maritime environments. We present\nthe first maritime panoptic obstacle detection benchmark LaRS, featuring scenes from Lakes, Rivers and Seas. Our major contribution is the new dataset, which boasts the largest diversity in recording locations, scene types, obsta- cle classes, and acquisition conditions among the related datasets. LaRS is composed of over 4000 per-pixel labeled key frames with nine preceding frames to allow utilization of the temporal texture, amounting to over 40k frames. Each key frame is annotated with 8 thing, 3 stuff classes and 19 global scene attributes. We report the results of 27 se- mantic and panoptic segmentation methods, along with sev- eral performance insights and future research directions. To enable objective evaluation, we have implemented an online evaluation server.

        "title": "Joint Metrics Matter: A Better Standard for Trajectory Forecasting",
        "abstract": "Multi-modal trajectory forecasting methods commonly evaluate using single-agent metrics (marginal metrics), such as minimum Average Displacement Error (ADE) and Final Displacement Error (FDE), which fail to capture joint performance of multiple interacting agents. Only focusing on marginal metrics can lead to unnatural predictions, such as colliding trajectories or diverging trajectories for people who are clearly walking together as a group. Consequently, methods optimized for marginal metrics lead to overly-optimistic estimations of performance, which is detrimental to progress in trajectory forecasting research. In response to the limitations of marginal metrics, we present the first comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the- art (SOTA) trajectory forecasting methods with respect\nto multi-agent metrics (joint metrics): JADE, JFDE, and collision rate. We demonstrate the importance of joint metrics as opposed to marginal metrics with quantitative evidence and qualitative examples drawn from the ETH / UCY and Stanford Drone datasets. We introduce a new loss function incorporating joint metrics that, when applied\nto a SOTA trajectory forecasting method, achieves a 7% improvement in JADE / JFDE on the ETH / UCY datasets with respect to the previous SOTA. Our results also indicate that optimizing for joint metrics naturally leads to an im- provement in interaction modeling, as evidenced by a 16% decrease in mean collision rate on the ETH / UCY datasets with respect to the previous SOTA.

        "abstract": "The creation of 2D realistic facial images and 3D face shapes using generative networks has been a hot topic in re- cent years. Existing face generators exhibit exceptional per- formance on faces in small to medium poses (with respect to frontal faces) but struggle to produce realistic results for large poses. The distorted rendering results on large poses in 3D-aware generators further show that the generated 3D face shapes are far from the distribution of 3D faces in real- ity. We find that the above issues are caused by the training dataset\u2019s pose imbalance.\nIn this paper, we present LPFF, a large-pose Flickr face dataset comprised of 19,590 high-quality real large-pose\nportrait images. We utilize our dataset to train a 2D face generator that can process large-pose face images, as well as a 3D-aware generator that can generate realistic human face geometry. To better validate our pose-conditional 3D- aware generators, we develop a new FID measure to evalu- ate the 3D-level performance. Through this novel FID mea- sure and other experiments, we show that LPFF can help 2D face generators extend their latent space and better ma- nipulate the large-pose data, and help 3D-aware face gen- erators achieve better view consistency and more realistic 3D reconstruction results.",

        "abstract": "Formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) is a pre- training method that relies on synthetic images generated from mathematical formulae such as fractals. Prior work on FDSL has shown that pre-training vision transformers on such synthetic datasets can yield competitive accuracy on a wide range of downstream tasks. These synthetic im- ages are categorized according to the parameters in the mathematical formula that generate them. In the present work, we hypothesize that the process for generating dif- ferent instances for the same category in FDSL, can be viewed as a form of data augmentation. We validate this hypothesis by replacing the instances with data augmenta- tion, which means we only need a single image per category. Our experiments shows that this one-instance fractal database (OFDB) performs better than the original dataset where instances were explicitly generated. We further scale up OFDB to 21,000 categories and show that it matches, or even surpasses, the model pre-trained on ImageNet-21k in ImageNet-1k fine-tuning. The number of images in OFDB is 21k, whereas ImageNet-21k has 14M. This opens new possibilities for pre-training vision transformers with much smaller datasets.",

This means during tasks such as classification and detection, model performance differs for certain classes based on the demographics of the people in the image. These dispari- ties have been shown to exist, but until now there has not been a unified approach to measure these differences for common use-cases of computer vision models. We present a new benchmark named FACET (FAirness in Computer Vi- sion EvaluaTion), a large, publicly available evaluation set of 32k images for some of the most common vision tasks - image classification, object detection and segmentation. For every image in FACET, we hired expert reviewers to arXiv:2309.00035v1 [cs.CV] 31 Aug 2023 manually annotate person-related attributes such as per- ceived skin tone and hair type, manually draw bounding boxes and label fine-grained person-related classes such as disk jockey or guitarist. In addition, we use FACET to benchmark state-of-the-art vision models and present a deeper understanding of potential performance dispari- ties and challenges across sensitive demographic attributes. With the exhaustive annotations collected, we probe models using single demographics attributes as well as multiple at- tributes using an intersectional approach (e.g. hair color and perceived skin tone). Our results show that classifica- tion, detection, segmentation, and visual grounding mod- els exhibit performance disparities across demographic at- tributes and intersections of attributes.

In this work, we introduce EmoSet, the first large-scale vi- sual emotion dataset annotated with rich attributes, which is superior to existing datasets in four aspects: scale, anno- tation richness, diversity, and data balance. EmoSet com- prises 3.3 million images in total, with 118,102 of these im- ages carefully labeled by human annotators, making it five times larger than the largest existing dataset. EmoSet in- cludes images from social networks, as well as artistic im- ages, and it is well balanced between different emotion cat- egories. Motivated by psychological studies, in addition to emotion category, each image is also annotated with a set of describable emotion attributes: brightness, colorfulness, scene type, object class, facial expression, and human ac- tion, which can help understand visual emotions in a precise and interpretable way. The relevance of these emotion at- tributes is validated by analyzing the correlations between them and visual emotion, as well as by designing an at- tribute module to help visual emotion recognition.

We introduce TIFA (Text-to-Image\nFaithfulness evaluation with question Answering), an auto-\nmatic evaluation metric that measures the faithfulness of a\ngenerated image to its text input via visual question answer-\ning (VQA). Specifically, given a text input, we automatically\ngenerate several question-answer pairs using a language\nmodel.

Addressing this, we introduce PlanarTrack, a large-scale challenging planar tracking benchmark. Specif- ically, PlanarTrack consists of 1,000 videos with more than 490K images. All these videos are collected in complex un- constrained scenarios from the wild, which makes Planar- Track, compared with existing benchmarks, more challeng- ing but realistic for real-world applications.

To our best knowledge, Planar- Track, to date, is the largest and most challenging dataset dedicated to planar object tracking. In order to analyze the proposed PlanarTrack, we evaluate 10 planar trackers and conduct comprehensive comparisons and in-depth analysis. Our results, not surprisingly, demonstrate that current top- performing planar trackers degenerate significantly on the challenging PlanarTrack and more efforts are needed to im- prove planar tracking in the future. In addition, we further derive a variant named PlanarTrackBB for generic object tracking from PlanarTrack. Our evaluation of 10 excellent generic trackers on PlanarTrackBB manifests that, surpris- ingly, PlanarTrackBB is even more challenging than several popular generic tracking benchmarks and more attention should be paid to handle such planar objects, though they\nare rigid.

A major challenge for accurate glaucoma detection and progression forecasting is the bottleneck of limited labeled patients with the state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3D retinal imaging data of optical coherence tomogra- phy (OCT). To address the data scarcity issue, this pa- per proposes two solutions. First, we develop a novel generalization-reinforced semi-supervised learning (SSL) model called pseudo supervisor to optimally utilize unla- beled data. Compared with SOTA models, the proposed pseudo supervisor optimizes the policy of predicting pseudo labels with unlabeled samples to improve empirical gener- alization. Our pseudo supervisor model is evaluated with\ntwo clinical tasks consisting of glaucoma detection and pro- gression forecasting. The progression forecasting task is evaluated both unimodally and multimodally. Our pseudo supervisor model demonstrates superior performance than SOTA SSL comparison models.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces the first two pixel retrieval bench- marks. Pixel retrieval is segmented instance retrieval. Like semantic segmentation extends classification to the pixel level, pixel retrieval is an extension of image retrieval and offers information about which pixels are related to the query object. In addition to retrieving images for the given query, it helps users quickly identify the query object in true positive images and exclude false positive images by de- noting the correlated pixels. Our user study results show pixel-level annotation can significantly improve the user ex-\nperience. Compared with semantic and instance segmenta- tion, pixel retrieval requires a fine-grained recognition ca- pability for variable-granularity targets. To this end, we propose pixel retrieval benchmarks named PROxford and PRParis, which are based on the widely used image re- trieval datasets, ROxford and RParis. Three professional annotators label 5,942 images with two rounds of double- checking and refinement. Furthermore, we conduct exten- sive experiments and analysis on the SOTA methods in im- age search, image matching, detection, segmentation, and dense matching using our pixel retrieval benchmarks. Re- sults show that the pixel retrieval task is challenging to these approaches and distinctive from existing problems, suggesting that further research can advance the content- based pixel-retrieval and thus user search experience.

We begin by revisiting the six commonly used benchmarks in STR and observe a trend of performance saturation, whereby only 2.91% of the benchmark images cannot be accurately recognized by an ensemble of 13 representative models. While these re- sults are impressive and suggest that STR could be consid- ered solved, however, we argue that this is primarily due to the less challenging nature of the common benchmarks, thus concealing the underlying issues that STR faces. To this end, we consolidate a large-scale real STR dataset, namely Union14M, which comprises 4 million labeled im-\nages and 10 million unlabeled images, to assess the per- formance of STR models in more complex real-world sce- narios. Our experiments demonstrate that the 13 models can only achieve an average accuracy of 66.53% on the 4 million labeled images, indicating that STR still faces numerous challenges in the real world. By analyzing the error patterns of the 13 models, we identify seven open challenges in STR and develop a challenge-driven bench- mark consisting of eight distinct subsets to facilitate fur- ther progress in the field. Our exploration demonstrates that STR is far from being solved and leveraging data may be a promising solution. In this regard, we find that utiliz- ing the 10 million unlabeled images through self-supervised pre-training can significantly improve the robustness of STR model in real-world scenarios and leads to state-of-the-art performance.

        "abstract": "The quality of the data and annotation upper-bounds the\nquality of a downstream model. While there exist large text\ncorpora and image-text pairs, high-quality video-text data\nis much harder to collect. First of all, manual labeling is\nmore time-consuming, as it requires an annotator to watch\nan entire video. Second, videos have a temporal dimension,\nconsisting of several scenes stacked together, and showing\nmultiple actions. Accordingly, to establish a video dataset\nwith high-quality captions, we propose an automatic approach leveraging multimodal inputs, such as textual video\ndescription, subtitles, and individual video frames. Specifically, we curate 3.8M high-resolution videos from the publicly available HD-VILA-100M dataset. We then split them\ninto semantically consistent video clips, and apply multiple\ncross-modality teacher models to obtain captions for each\nvideo. Next, we finetune a retrieval model on a small subset\nwhere the best caption of each video is manually selected\nand then employ the model in the whole dataset to select\nthe best caption as the annotation. In this way, we get 70M\nvideos paired with high-quality text captions. We dub the\ndataset as Panda-70M. We show the value of the proposed\ndataset on three downstream tasks: video captioning, video\nand text retrieval, and text-driven video generation. The\nmodels trained on the proposed data score substantially better on the majority of metrics across all the tasks.",

To fill this gap, we introduce a specialized traffic monitoring dataset, termed TSP6K, containing images from the traffic monitoring scenario, with high-quality pixellevel and instance-level annotations. The TSP6K dataset captures more crowded traffic scenes with several times more traffic participants than the existing driving scenes. We perform a detailed analysis of the dataset and comprehensively evaluate previous popular scene parsing methods, instance segmentation methods and unsupervised domain adaption methods. Furthermore, considering the vast difference in instance sizes, we propose a detail refining decoder for scene parsing, which recovers the details of different semantic regions in traffic scenes owing to the proposed TSP6K dataset.

The clinical treatments\nrequire temperature feedback must be rapid and accurate. Purpose: This work aims to enhance\ntemporal resolution in dynamic MR temperature map reconstruction with an improved deep learning\nmethod, to ensure the safety and effectiveness of FUS treatments.\nMethods: The training-optimized methods and five classical neural networks were applied on the\n2-fold and 4-fold under-sampling k-space data to reconstruct the temperature maps. The used neural\nnetworks were cascade net, complex valued U-Net, shift window transformer for MRI, real valued\nU-Net and U-Net with residual block. The enhanced training modules included offline/online data\naugmentations, knowledge distillation, and the amplitude-phase decoupling loss function. The heating\nexperiments were performed by a FUS transducer on phantom and ex vivo tissues, respectively. In\ndatasets, the ground-truth was the complex MR images with accurate temperature increases. These\ndata were also manually under-sampled to imitate acceleration procedures and trained in our method\nto get the reconstruction model. The additional dozen or so testing datasets were separately obtained\nfor evaluating the real-time performance and temperature accuracy.\nResults: Acceleration factors of 1.9 and 3.7 were found for 2\u00d7 and 4\u00d7 k-space under-sampling\nstrategies and the ResUNet-based deep learning reconstruction performed exceptionally well. In\n2-fold acceleration scenario, the RMSE of temperature map patches provided the values of 0.888 \u00b0C\nand 1.145 \u00b0C on phantom and ex vivo testing datasets. The DICE value of temperature areas enclosed\nby 43 \u00b0C isotherm was 0.809, and the Bland-Altman analysis showed a bias of \u22120.253 \u00b0C with the\napart of \u00b12.16 \u00b0C. In 4\u00d7 under-sampling case, these evaluating values decreased by approximately\n10%.\nConclusion: This study demonstrates that the application of deep learning-based reconstruction\nsignificantly enhances the accuracy and efficiency of MR thermometry, particularly benefiting the\nclinical thermal therapies for uterine fibroid, essential tremor, and prostate cancer by FUS.\nThe source code for our optimizing methods and neural networks is available at: https://github.\ncom/minipuding/FastMRT.",

        "abstract": "In digital pathology, the traditional method for deep learning-based\nimage segmentation typically involves a two-stage process: initially segmenting\nhigh-resolution whole slide images (WSI) into smaller patches (e.g., 256\n\u00d7 256\n,\n512\n\u00d7 512\n, 1024\n\u00d7 1024) and subsequently reconstructing them to their original\nscale. This method often struggles to capture the complex details and vast scope\nof WSIs. In this paper, we propose the holistic histopathology (HoloHisto) segmentation method to achieve end-to-end segmentation on gigapixel WSIs, whose\nmaximum resolution is above 80,000\n\u00d770,000 pixels. HoloHisto fundamentally\nshifts the paradigm of WSI segmentation to an end-to-end learning fashion with\n1) a large (4K) resolution base patch for elevated visual information inclusion\nand efficient processing, and 2) a novel sequential tokenization mechanism to\nproperly model the contextual relationships and efficiently model the rich information from the 4K input. To our best knowledge, HoloHisto presents the first\nholistic approach for gigapixel resolution WSI segmentation, supporting direct\nI/O of complete WSI and their corresponding gigapixel masks. Under the HoloHisto platform, we unveil a random 4K sampler that transcends ultra-high resolution, delivering 31 and 10 times more pixels than standard 2D and 3D patches,\nrespectively, for advancing computational capabilities. To facilitate efficient 4K\nresolution dense prediction, we leverage sequential tokenization, utilizing a pretrained image tokenizer to group image features into a discrete token grid. To\nassess the performance, our team curated a new kidney pathology image segmentation (KPIs) dataset with WSI-level glomeruli segmentation from whole mouse\nkidneys. From the results, HoloHisto-4K delivers remarkable performance gains\nover previous state-of-the-art models.\"",

Current mainstream adversarial attack methods only consider one of\nthe distortions among L0-norm, L2-norm, and L\u221e-norm. L0-norm based methods\ncause large modification on a single pixel, resulting in naked-eye visible detection,\nwhile L2-norm and L\u221e-norm based methods suffer from weak robustness against\nadversarial defense since they always diffuse tiny perturbations to all pixels. A\nmore realistic adversarial perturbation should be sparse and imperceptible. In this\npaper, we propose a novel Lp-norm distortion-efficient adversarial attack, which\nnot only owns the least L2-norm (or L\u221e-norm) loss but also significantly reduces\nthe L0-norm distortion. To this aim, we design a new optimization scheme, which\nfirst optimizes an initial adversarial perturbation under L2-norm (or L\u221e-norm)\nconstraint, and then constructs a dimension unimportance matrix for the initial\nperturbation. Such a dimension unimportance matrix can indicate the adversarial unimportance of each dimension of the initial perturbation. Furthermore, we\nintroduce a new concept of adversarial threshold for the dimension unimportance\nmatrix. The dimensions of the initial perturbation whose unimportance is higher\nthan the threshold will be all set to zero, greatly decreasing the L0-norm distortion.\nExperimental results on three benchmark datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10, and ImageNet) show that under the same query budget, the adversarial examples generated\nby our method have lower L0-norm and L2-norm (or L\u221e-norm) distortion than the\nstate-of-the-art.

        "abstract": "Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLM) relies on\nthe powerful LLM to perform multimodal tasks, showing\namazing emergent abilities in recent studies, such as writing poems based on an image. However, it is difficult for\nthese case studies to fully reflect the performance of MLLM,\nlacking a comprehensive evaluation. In this paper, we fill\nin this blank, presenting the first comprehensive MLLM\nEvaluation benchmark MME1\n. It measures both perception\nand cognition abilities on a total of 14 subtasks. In order\nto avoid data leakage that may arise from direct use of public datasets for evaluation, the annotations of instructionanswer pairs are all manually designed. The concise instruction design allows us to fairly compare MLLMs, instead of struggling in prompt engineering. Besides, with\nsuch an instruction, we can also easily carry out quantitative statistics. A total of 30 advanced MLLMs are comprehensively evaluated on our MME, which not only suggests that existing MLLMs still have a large room for improvement, but also reveals the potential directions for the\nsubsequent model optimization.

This work introduces\nan end-to-end trainable two-stream video prediction framework, Motion-Matrix-based Video Prediction (MMVP), to\ntackle this challenge.

        "abstract": "Large-scale generative language and vision-language models (LLMs and VLMs) excel in few-shot in-context learning for decision making and instruction following. However, they require high-quality exemplar demonstrations to be included in their context window. In this work, we ask: Can LLMs and VLMs generate their own prompt examples from generic, sub-optimal demonstrations? We propose In-Context Abstraction Learning (ICAL), a method that builds a memory of multimodal experience insights from sub-optimal demonstrations and human feedback. Given a noisy demonstration in a new domain, VLMs abstract the trajectory into a general program by fixing inefficient actions and annotating cognitive abstractions: task relationships, object state changes, temporal subgoals, and task construals. These abstractions are refined and adapted interactively through human feedback while the agent attempts to execute the trajectory in a similar environment. The resulting abstractions, when used as exemplars in the prompt, significantly improve decision-making in retrieval-augmented LLM and VLM agents. Our ICAL agent surpasses the state-of-the-art in dialogue-based instruction following in TEACh, multimodal web agents in VisualWebArena, and action anticipation in Ego4D. In TEACh, we achieve a 12.6% improvement in goal-condition success. In VisualWebArena, our task success rate improves over the SOTA from 14.3% to 22.7%. In Ego4D action forecasting, we improve over few-shot GPT-4V and remain competitive with supervised models. We show finetuning our retrieval-augmented in-context agent yields additional improvements. Our approach significantly reduces reliance on expert-crafted examples and consistently outperforms in-context learning from action plans that lack such insights.",

        "abstract": "Efficient single instance segmentation is essential for unlocking features in the mobile imaging applications, such as capture or editing. Existing on-the-fly mobile imaging applications scope the segmentation task to portraits or the salient subject due to the computational constraints. Instance segmentation, despite its re- cent developments towards efficient networks, is still heavy due to the cost of computation on the entire image to identify all in- stances. To address this, we propose and formulate a one tap driven single instance segmentation task that segments a single instance selected by a user via a positive tap. This task, in contrast to the broader task of segmenting anything as suggested in the Segment Anything Model [19], focuses on efficient segmentation of a single instance specified by the user. To solve this problem, we present TraceNet, which explicitly locates the selected instance by way of receptive field tracing. TraceNet identifies image regions that are related to the user tap and heavy computations are only performed on selected regions of the image. Therefore overall computation cost and memory consumption are reduced during inference. We evaluate the performance of TraceNet on instance IoU average over taps and the proportion of the region that a user tap can fall into for a high-quality single-instance mask. Experimental results on MS-COCO and LVIS demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. TraceNet can jointly achieve the efficiency and interactivity, filling in the gap between needs for efficient mo- bile inference and recent research trend towards multimodal and interactive segmentation models.",

Named Entity Recognition (NER) models underperform when capturing entities from Malaysian English text due to its distinctive morphosyntactic adaptations, semantic features and code-switching (mixing English and Malay). Considering these gaps, we introduce MENmBERT and MENBERT, a pre-trained language model with contextual understanding, specifically tailored for Malaysian English. We have fine-tuned MENmBERT and MENBERT using manually annotated entities and relations from the Malaysian English News Article (MEN) Dataset. This fine-tuning process allows the PLM to learn representations that capture the nuances of Malaysian English relevant for NER and RE tasks. MENmBERT achieved a 1.52\\% and 26.27\\% improvement on NER and RE tasks respectively compared to the bert-base-multilingual-cased model. Although the overall performance of NER does not have a significant improvement, our further analysis shows that there is a significant improvement when evaluated by the 12 entity labels. These findings suggest that pre-training language models on language-specific and geographically-focused corpora can be a promising approach for improving NER performance in low-resource settings.

In particular the target low-resource language (L_T) will be simulated with French, as it lacks of task-specific resources and allows our human evaluation, when the source language (L_S) is English. For obvious reasons, recent works using such models for open-domain dialogue are mostly developed in English. Yet building specific PLMs for each possible target language supposes collecting new datasets and is costly. For this reason, trying to leverage all existing resources (PLMs and data) in both L_S and L_T , we wish to assess the performance achievable in L_T with different approaches. The first two approaches evaluate the usage of Neural Machine Translation (NMT) at different levels: TrainOnTarget where a L_S dataset is translated before fine-tuning in L_T and TestOnSource where a L_S model is coupled with NMT modules during inference. Then, the advent of BLOOM [2], the world first open-access multilingual large PLM, allow researchers to develop new approaches aiming to leverage not only the model's full accessibility but also its multilingualism and translation abilities. In this context the task is learned in L_S first and adapted to L_T using the MAD-X Adapter architecture [16]. In the two sets of experiments models are evaluated in spoken dialogue conditions with human and the strategies can be compared in terms of perceived interaction quality.",

In this work, we emphasize the importance of structure information in Visual Document Understanding and propose the Unified Structure Learning to boost the performance of MLLMs. Our Unified Structure Learning comprises structureaware parsing tasks and multi-grained text localization tasks across 5 domains: document, webpage, table, chart, and natural image. To better encode structure information, we design a simple and effective vision-to-text module H-Reducer, which can not only maintain the layout information but also reduce the length of visual features by merging horizontal adjacent patches through convolution, enabling the LLM to understand high-resolution images more efficiently. Furthermore, by constructing structure-aware text sequences and multi-grained pairs of texts and bounding boxes for publicly available text-rich images, we build a comprehensive training set DocStruct4M to support structure learning. Finally, we construct a small but high-quality reasoning tuning dataset DocReason25K to trigger the detailed explanation ability in the document domain.

Without a comprehensive benchmark, it remains unexplored how these FCE methods perform on other LLMs with different error distributions or even unseen error types, as these methods may fail to detect the error types generated by other LLMs. To fill this gap, in this paper, we propose the first comprehensive FCE benchmark \\emph{Face4RAG} for RAG independent of the underlying LLM. Our benchmark consists of a synthetic dataset built upon a carefully designed typology for factuality inconsistency error and a real-world dataset constructed from six commonly used LLMs, enabling evaluation of FCE methods on specific error types or real-world error distributions. On the proposed benchmark, we discover the failure of existing FCE methods to detect the logical fallacy, which refers to a mismatch of logic structures between the answer and the retrieved reference. To fix this issue, we further propose a new method called \\emph{L-Face4RAG} with two novel designs of logic-preserving answer decomposition and fact-logic FCE. Extensive experiments show L-Face4RAG substantially outperforms previous methods for factual inconsistency detection on a wide range of tasks, notably beyond the RAG task from which it is originally motivated.

The task is challenging since state-of-the-art LLMs exhibit significant drops in MIA as compared to AIA. Moreover, we find that the chain-of-thought prompting technique not only fails to consistently enhance MIA, but can also lead to underperformance compared to simple prompting.

Existing saliency methods either misalign with LLM generation objectives or rely heavily on linearity assumptions, leading to potential inaccuracies. To address this, we propose Token Distribution Dynamics (TDD), a simple yet effective approach to unveil and manipulate the role of prompts in generating LLM outputs. TDD leverages the robust interpreting capabilities of the language model head (LM head) to assess input saliency. It projects input tokens into the embedding space and then estimates their significance based on distribution dynamics over the vocabulary. We introduce three TDD variants: forward, backward, and bidirectional, each offering unique insights into token relevance. Extensive experiments reveal that the TDD surpasses state-of-the-art baselines with a big margin in elucidating the causal relationships between prompts and LLM outputs. Beyond mere interpretation, we apply TDD to two prompt manipulation tasks for controlled text generation: zero-shot toxic language suppression and sentiment steering. Empirical results underscore TDD\u2019s proficiency in identifying both toxic and sentimental cues in prompts, subsequently mitigating toxicity or modulating sentiment in the generated content.",

        "abstract": "The field of natural language processing (NLP) has witnessed significant progress in recent years, with a notable focus on improving large language models\u2019 (LLM) performance through innovative prompting techniques. Among these, prompt engineering coupled with structures has emerged as a promising paradigm, with designs such as Chain-of-Thought, Tree of Thoughts, or Graph of Thoughts, in which the overall LLM reasoning is guided by a structure such as a graph. As illustrated with numerous examples, this paradigm significantly enhances the LLM\u2019s capability to solve numerous tasks, ranging from logical or mathematical reasoning to planning or creative writing. To facilitate the understanding of this growing field and pave the way for future developments, we devise a general blueprint for effective and efficient LLM reasoning schemes. For this, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the prompt execution pipeline, clarifying and clearly defining different concepts. We then build the first taxonomy of structure-enhanced LLM reasoning schemes. We focus on identifying fundamental classes of harnessed structures, and we analyze the representations of these structures, algorithms executed with these structures, and many others. We refer to these structures as reasoning topologies, because their representation becomes to a degree spatial, as they are contained within the LLM context. Our study compares existing prompting schemes using the proposed taxonomy, discussing how certain design choices lead to different patterns in performance and cost. We also outline theoretical underpinnings, relationships between prompting and other parts of the LLM ecosystem such as knowledge bases, and the associated research challenges. Our work will help to advance future prompt engineering techniques.",

This research introduces an innovative solution: the ``Energy-Optimized Semantic Loss'' (EOSL) function, a novel multi-objective loss function that effectively balances semantic information loss and energy consumption. Through comprehensive experiments on transformer models, including energy benchmarking, we demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of EOSL-based model selection.

Recently, advancements in model editing techniques, such as Rank-One Model Editing (ROME), have paved the way for updating LLMs with new knowledge. However, the efficacy of these methods varies across different types of knowledge. This study investigates the capability of knowledge editing methods to incorporate new knowledge with varying degrees of \"perplexingness\", a term we use to describe the initial difficulty LLMs have in understanding new concepts. We begin by quantifying the \"perplexingness\" of target knowledge using pre-edit conditional probabilities, and assess the efficacy of edits through post-edit conditional probabilities. Utilizing the widely-used CounterFact dataset, we find significant negative correlations between the \"perplexingness\" of the new knowledge and the edit efficacy across all 12 scenarios. To dive deeper into this phenomenon, we introduce a novel dataset, HierarchyData, consisting of 99 hyponym-hypernym pairs across diverse categories. Our analysis reveal that more abstract concepts (hypernyms) tend to be more perplexing than their specific counterparts (hyponyms). Further exploration into the influence of knowledge hierarchy on editing outcomes indicates that knowledge positioned at higher hierarchical levels is more challenging to modify in some scenarios. Our research highlights a previously overlooked aspect of LLM editing: the variable efficacy of editing methods in handling perplexing knowledge.

This study investigates whether the quality of LLM responses varies depending on the demographic profile of users. Considering English as the global lingua franca, along with the diversity of its dialects among speakers of different native languages, we explore whether non-native English speakers receive lower-quality or even factually incorrect responses from LLMs more frequently. Our results show that performance discrepancies occur when LLMs are prompted by native versus non-native English speakers and persist when comparing native speakers from Western countries with others. Additionally, we find a strong anchoring effect when the model recognizes or is made aware of the user's nativeness, which further degrades the response quality when interacting with non-native speakers. Our analysis is based on a newly collected dataset with over 12,000 unique annotations from 124 annotators, including information on their native language and English proficiency.",

        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) possess extensive parametric knowledge, but this knowledge is difficult to update with new information because retraining is very expensive and infeasible for closed-source models. Knowledge editing (KE) has emerged as a viable solution for updating the knowledge of LLMs without compromising their overall performance. On-the-fly KE methods, inspired by in-context learning (ICL), have shown great promise and allow LLMs to be treated as black boxes. In the past, KE was primarily employed in English contexts, whereas the potential for cross-lingual KE in current English-centric LLMs has not been fully explored. To foster more research in this direction, we introduce the BMIKE-53 benchmark for evaluating cross-lingual KE on 53 diverse languages across three KE task types. We also propose a gradient-free KE method called Multilingual In-context Knowledge Editing (MIKE) and evaluate it on BMIKE-53. Our evaluation focuses on cross-lingual knowledge transfer in terms of reliability, generality, locality, and portability, offering valuable insights and a framework for future research in cross-lingual KE.

While long-form QA has been well-studied in English via many different datasets and evaluation metrics, this research has not been extended to cover most other languages. To bridge this gap, we introduce CaLMQA, a collection of 2.6K complex questions spanning 23 languages, including under-resourced, rarely-studied languages such as Fijian and Kirundi. Our dataset includes both naturally-occurring questions collected from community web forums as well as questions written by native speakers, whom we hire for this purpose. Our process yields diverse, complex questions that reflect cultural topics (e.g. traditions, laws, news) and the language usage of native speakers. We conduct automatic evaluation across a suite of open- and closed-source models using our novel metric CaLMScore, which detects incorrect language and token repetitions in answers, and observe that the quality of LLM-generated answers degrades significantly for some low-resource languages. We perform human evaluation on a subset of models and see that model performance is significantly worse for culturally specific questions than for culturally agnostic questions. Our findings highlight the need for further research in LLM multilingual capabilities and non-English LFQA evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Automatic medical discovery by AI is a dream of many. One step toward that goal is to create an AI model to understand clinical studies and synthesize clinical evidence from the literature. Clinical evidence synthesis currently relies on systematic reviews of clinical trials and retrospective analyses from medical literature. However, the rapid expansion of publications presents challenges in efficiently identifying, summarizing, and updating evidence. We introduce TrialMind, a generative AI-based pipeline for conducting medical systematic reviews, encompassing study search, screening, and data extraction phases. We utilize large language models (LLMs) to drive each pipeline component while incorporating human expert oversight to minimize errors. To facilitate evaluation, we also create a benchmark dataset TrialReviewBench, a custom dataset with 870 annotated clinical studies from 25 meta-analysis papers across various medical treatments. Our results demonstrate that TrialMind significantly improves the literature review process, achieving high recall rates (0.897-1.000) in study searching from over 20 million PubMed studies and outperforming traditional language model embeddings-based methods in screening (Recall@20 of 0.227-0.246 vs. 0.000-0.102). Furthermore, our approach surpasses direct GPT-4 performance in result extraction, with accuracy ranging from 0.65 to 0.84. We also support clinical evidence synthesis in forest plots, as validated by eight human annotators who preferred TrialMind over the GPT-4 baseline with a winning rate of 62.5%-100% across the involved reviews. Our findings suggest that an LLM-based clinical evidence synthesis approach, such as TrialMind, can enable reliable and high-quality clinical evidence synthesis to improve clinical research efficiency.",

With the rapid development of machine learning models today, the performance of existing machine learning models has quickly reached state-of-the-art results on a variety of tasks related to natural language processing, including natural language inference tasks. By using a pre-trained model during the annotation process, it is possible to challenge current NLI models by having humans produce premise-hypothesis combinations that the machine model cannot correctly predict. To remain attractive and challenging in the research of natural language inference for Vietnamese, in this paper, we introduce the adversarial NLI dataset to the NLP research community with the name ViANLI. This data set contains more than 10K premise-hypothesis pairs and is built by a continuously adjusting process to obtain the most out of the patterns generated by the annotators. ViANLI dataset has brought many difficulties to many current SOTA models when the accuracy of the most powerful model on the test set only reached 48.4%.

        "abstract": "The alignment process changes several properties of a large language model's (LLM's) output distribution. We analyze two aspects of post-alignment distributional shift of LLM responses. First, we re-examine previously reported reductions in response diversity post-alignment. Our analysis suggests that an apparent drop in the diversity of responses is largely explained by quality control and information aggregation. Alignment suppresses irrelevant and unhelpful content while shifting the output distribution toward longer responses that cover information spanning several responses from the base LLM, essentially presenting diverse information in a single response. Finding little evidence that alignment suppresses useful information, it is natural to ask the opposite question: do aligned models surface information that cannot be recovered from base models? Our second investigation shows this is not the case and the behavior of aligned models is recoverable from base models without fine-tuning. A combination of in-context examples and lower-resolution semantic hints about response content can elicit responses from base LLMs that are as similar to alignment-tuned LLM responses as alignment-tuned LLM responses are to each other. Taken together, these results indicate that current alignment techniques capture but do not extend the useful subset of assistant-like base LLM behavior, providing further evidence for the Superficial Alignment Hypothesis. They also show that in-context alignment can go surprisingly far as a strategy for imitating aligned LLMs without fine-tuning. Our code and data is available at this https URL.",

        "abstract": "As large language models achieve impressive scores on traditional benchmarks, an increasing number of researchers are becoming concerned about benchmark data leakage during pre-training, commonly known as the data contamination problem. To ensure fair evaluation, recent benchmarks release only the training and validation sets, keeping the test set labels closed-source. They require anyone wishing to evaluate his language model to submit the model's predictions for centralized processing and then publish the model's result on their leaderboard. However, this submission process is inefficient and prevents effective error analysis. To address this issue, we propose to variabilize benchmarks and evaluate language models dynamically. Specifically, we extract variables from each test case and define a value range for each variable. For each evaluation, we sample new values from these value ranges to create unique test cases, thus ensuring a fresh evaluation each time. We applied this variable perturbation method to four datasets: GSM8K, ARC, CommonsenseQA, and TruthfulQA, which cover mathematical generation and multiple-choice tasks. Our experimental results demonstrate that this approach provides a more accurate assessment of the true capabilities of language models, effectively mitigating the contamination problem.",

The broader integration of LLMs into society has sparked interest in whether they manifest psychological attributes, and whether these attributes are stable-inquiries that could deepen the understanding of their behaviors. Inspired by psychometrics, this paper presents a framework for investigating psychology in LLMs, including psychological dimension identification, assessment dataset curation, and assessment with results validation. Following this framework, we introduce a comprehensive psychometrics benchmark for LLMs that covers six psychological dimensions: personality, values, emotion, theory of mind, motivation, and intelligence. This benchmark includes thirteen datasets featuring diverse scenarios and item types. Our findings indicate that LLMs manifest a broad spectrum of psychological attributes. We also uncover discrepancies between LLMs' self-reported traits and their behaviors in real-world scenarios. This paper demonstrates a thorough psychometric assessment of LLMs, providing insights into reliable evaluation and potential applications in AI and social sciences.",

To evaluate the performance of LLMs in different scenarios, various assessment benchmarks have emerged. However, as most of these benchmarks focus on identifying key information to answer questions, which mainly requires the retrieval ability of LLMs, these benchmarks can partially represent the reasoning performance of LLMs from large amounts of information. Meanwhile, although LLMs often claim to have context windows of 32k, 128k, 200k, or even longer, these benchmarks fail to reveal the actual supported length of these LLMs. To address these issues, we propose the LongIns benchmark dataset, a challenging long-context instruction-based exam for LLMs, which is built based on the existing instruction datasets. Specifically, in our LongIns, we introduce three evaluation settings: Global Instruction & Single Task (GIST), Local Instruction & Single Task (LIST), and Local Instruction & Multiple Tasks (LIMT). Based on LongIns, we perform comprehensive evaluations on existing LLMs and have the following important findings: (1). The top-performing GPT-4 with 128k context length performs poorly on the evaluation context window of 16k in our LongIns. (2). For the multi-hop reasoning ability of many existing LLMs, significant efforts are still needed under short context windows (less than 4k).",

In Orca 2, we continue exploring how improved training signals can enhance smaller LMs\u2019 reasoning abilities. Research on training small LMs has often relied on imitation learning to replicate the output of more capable models. We contend that excessive emphasis on imitation may restrict the potential of smaller models. We seek to teach small LMs to employ different solution strategies for different tasks, potentially different from the one used by the larger model. For example, while larger models might provide a direct answer to a complex task, smaller models may not have the same capacity. In Orca 2, we teach the model various reasoning techniques (step-by-step, recall then generate, recall-reason-generate, direct answer, etc.). Moreover, we aim to help the model learn to determine the most effective solution strategy for each task. We evaluate Orca 2 using a comprehensive set of 15 diverse benchmarks (corresponding to approximately 100 tasks and over 36K unique prompts). Orca 2 significantly surpasses models of similar size and attains performance levels similar or better to those of models 5-10x larger, as assessed on complex tasks that test advanced reasoning abilities in zero-shot settings.

Mathematical word problem-solving has long been recognized as a complex task for small language models (SLMs). A recent study hypothesized that the smallest model size, needed to achieve over 80% accuracy on the GSM8K benchmark, is 34 billion parameters. To reach this level of performance with smaller models, researcher often train SLMs to generate Python code or use tools to help avoid calculation errors. Additionally, they employ ensembling, where outputs of up to 100 model runs are combined to arrive at a more accurate result. Result selection is done using consensus, majority vote or a separate a verifier model used in conjunction with the SLM. Ensembling provides a substantial boost in accuracy but at a significant cost increase with multiple calls to the model (e.g., Phi-GSM uses top-48 to boost the performance from 68.2 to 81.5, [38] uses top-100 to boost LLAMA-2\u2019s performance from 38.6% to 71.9%). In this work, we present Orca-Math, a 7-billion-parameter SLM based on the Mistral-7B, which achieves 86.81% on GSM8k without the need for multiple model calls or the use of verifiers, code execution or any other external tools. Our approach has the following key elements: (1) A high quality synthetic dataset of 200K math problems created using a multiagent setup where agents collaborate to create the data, (2) An iterative learning techniques that enables the SLM to practice solving problems, receive feedback on its solutions and learn from preference pairs incorporating the SLM solutions and the feedback. When trained with Supervised Fine-Tuning alone, Orca-Math achieves 81.50% on GSM8k pass@1 metric. With iterative preference learning, Orca-Math achieves 86.81% pass@1.

Existing work shows that when prompted with a chain of thoughts (CoT), sequences of short sentences describing intermediate reasoning steps towards a final answer, large language models can generate new reasoning chains and predict answers for new inputs. A central question is which reasoning examples make the most effective prompts. In this work, we propose complexitybased prompting, a simple and effective example selection scheme for multi-step reasoning. We show that prompts with higher reasoning complexity, i.e., chains with more reasoning steps, achieve substantially better performance on multistep reasoning tasks over strong baselines. We further extend our complexitybased criteria from prompting (selecting inputs) to decoding (selecting outputs), where we sample multiple reasoning chains from the model, then choose the majority of generated answers from complex reasoning chains (over simple chains). When used to prompt GPT-3 and Codex, our approach substantially improves multi-step reasoning accuracy and achieves new state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on three math benchmarks (GSM8K, MultiArith, and MathQA) and two BigBenchHard tasks (Date Understanding and Penguins), with an average +5.3 and up to +18 accuracy improvements. Compared with existing example selection schemes like manual tuning or retrieval-based selection, selection based on reasoning complexity is intuitive, easy to implement, and annotation-efficient.

This is inspired by our human behaviors, i.e., we can draw a mind map or knowledge map as the reasoning evidence in the brain before answering a complex question. Benefiting from CoK, we additionally introduce a F2 -Verification method to estimate the reliability of the reasoning chains in terms of factuality and faithfulness. For the unreliable response, the wrong evidence can be indicated to prompt the LLM to rethink.

To fill in this gap, we propose CROSSCODEEVAL, a diverse and multilingual code completion benchmark that necessitates an in-depth cross-file contextual understanding to complete the code accurately.

        "abstract": "In the field of phase change phenomena, the lack of accessible and diverse datasets suitable for machine learning (ML) training poses a significant challenge. Existing experimental datasets are often restricted, with limited availability and sparse ground truth data, impeding our understanding of this complex multiphysics phenomena. To bridge this gap, we present the BubbleML Dataset 1 which leverages physics-driven simulations to provide accurate ground truth information for various boiling scenarios, encompassing nucleate pool boiling, flow boiling, and sub-cooled boiling. This extensive dataset covers a wide range of parameters, including varying gravity conditions, flow rates, sub-cooling levels, and wall superheat, comprising 79 simulations. BubbleML is validated against experimental observations and trends, establishing it as an invaluable resource for ML research. Furthermore, we showcase its potential to facilitate exploration of diverse downstream tasks by introducing two benchmarks: (a) optical flow analysis to capture bubble dynamics, and (b) operator networks for learning temperature dynamics. The BubbleML dataset and its benchmarks serve as a catalyst for advancements in ML-driven research on multiphysics phase change phenomena, enabling the development and comparison of state-of-the-art techniques and models.",

Neglecting the fundamen- tal importance of data has given rise to inaccuracy, bias, and fragility in real-world applications, and research is hindered by saturation across existing dataset bench- marks. In response, we present DataPerf, a community-led benchmark suite for evaluating ML datasets and data-centric algorithms. We aim to foster innovation in data-centric AI through competition, comparability, and reproducibility. We enable the ML community to iterate on datasets, instead of just architectures, and we provide an open, online platform with multiple rounds of challenges to support this iterative development. The first iteration of DataPerf contains five benchmarks covering a wide spectrum of data-centric techniques, tasks, and modalities in vi- sion, speech, acquisition, debugging, and diffusion prompting, and we support hosting new contributed benchmarks from the community. The benchmarks, on- line evaluation platform, and baseline implementations are open source, and the MLCommons Association will maintain DataPerf to ensure long-term benefits to academia and industry.",

        "abstract": "Subseasonal forecasting of the weather two to six weeks in advance is critical for resource allocation and advance disaster notice but poses many challenges for the forecasting community. At this forecast horizon, physics-based dynami- cal models have limited skill, and the targets for prediction depend in a complex manner on both local weather and global climate variables. Recently, machine learning methods have shown promise in advancing the state of the art but only at the cost of complex data curation, integrating expert knowledge with aggrega- tion across multiple relevant data sources, file formats, and temporal and spatial resolutions. To streamline this process and accelerate future development, we introduce SubseasonalClimateUSA, a curated dataset for training and benchmark- ing subseasonal forecasting models in the United States. We use this dataset to benchmark a diverse suite of subseasonal models, including operational dynamical models, classical meteorological baselines, and ten state-of-the-art machine learn- ing and deep learning-based methods from the literature. Overall, our benchmarks suggest simple and effective ways to extend the accuracy of current operational models.

        "abstract": "The human visual system can effortlessly recognize an object under different extrinsic factors such as lighting, object poses, and background, yet current com- puter vision systems often struggle with these variations. An important step to understanding and improving artificial vision systems is to measure image simi- larity purely based on intrinsic object properties that define object identity. This problem has been studied in the computer vision literature as re-identification, though mostly restricted to specific object categories such as people and cars. We propose to extend it to general object categories, exploring an image simi- larity metric based on object intrinsics. To benchmark such measurements, we collect the Common paired objects Under differenT Extrinsics (CUTE) dataset of 18, 000 images of 180 objects under different extrinsic factors such as light- ing, poses, and imaging conditions. While existing methods such as LPIPS and CLIP scores do not measure object intrinsics well, we find that combining deep features learned from contrastive self-supervised learning with foreground filtering is a simple yet effective approach to approximating the similarity. We conduct an extensive survey of pre-trained features and foreground extraction methods to arrive at a strong baseline that best measures intrinsic object-centric image similarity among current methods. Finally, we demonstrate that our approach can aid in downstream applications such as acting as an analog for human subjects and improving generalizable re-identification.

The machine learning (ML) community has taken an increased interest in supporting climate scientists\u2019 efforts on various tasks such as climate model emulation, downscaling, and prediction tasks. Many of those tasks have been addressed on datasets created with single climate models. However, both the climate science and ML communities have suggested that to address those tasks at scale, we need large, consistent, and ML-ready climate model datasets. Here, we introduce ClimateSet, a dataset containing the inputs and outputs of 36 climate models from the Input4MIPs and CMIP6 archives. In addition, we provide a modular dataset pipeline for retrieving and preprocessing additional climate models and scenarios. We showcase the potential of our dataset by using it as a benchmark for ML-based climate model emulation. We gain new insights about the performance and generalization capabilities of the different ML models by analyzing their performance across different climate models. Furthermore, the dataset can be used to train an ML emulator on several climate models instead of just one. Such a \u201csuper emulator\u201d can quickly project new climate change scenarios, complementing existing scenarios already provided to policymakers. We believe ClimateSet will create the basis needed for the ML community to tackle climate-related tasks at scale.",

In this paper, we introduce EHRXQA, a novel multi-modal ques- tion answering dataset combining structured EHRs and chest X-ray images. To develop our dataset, we first construct two uni-modal resources: 1) The MIMIC- CXR-VQA dataset, our newly created medical visual question answering (VQA) benchmark, specifically designed to augment the imaging modality in EHR QA, and 2) EHRSQL (MIMIC-IV), a refashioned version of a previously established table-based EHR QA dataset. By integrating these two uni-modal resources, we successfully construct a multi-modal EHR QA dataset that necessitates both uni-modal and cross-modal reasoning. To address the unique challenges of multi- modal questions within EHRs, we propose a NeuralSQL-based strategy equipped with an external VQA API.

        "abstract": "As machine learning-enabled Text-to-Image (TTI) systems are becoming increasingly prevalent and seeing growing adoption as commercial services, characterizing the social biases they exhibit is a necessary first step to lowering their risk of discriminatory outcomes. This evaluation, however, is made more difficult by the synthetic nature of these systems\u2019 outputs: common definitions of diversity are grounded in social categories of people living in the world, whereas the artificial depictions of fictive humans created by these systems have no inherent gender or ethnicity. To address this need, we propose a new method for exploring the social biases in TTI systems. Our approach relies on characterizing the variation in generated images triggered by enumerating gender and ethnicity markers in the prompts, and comparing it to the variation engendered by spanning different professions. This allows us to (1) identify specific bias trends, (2) provide targeted scores to directly compare models in terms of diversity and representation, and (3) jointly model interdependent social variables to support a multidimensional analysis. We leverage this method to analyze images generated by 3 popular TTI systems (Dall\u00b7E 2, Stable Diffusion v 1.4 and 2) and find that while all of their outputs show correlations with US labor demographics, they also consistently under-represent marginalized identities to different extents. We also release the datasets and low-code interactive bias exploration platforms developed for this work, as well as the necessary tools to similarly evaluate additional TTI systems.",

Addressing such performance gaps remains a challenge, as little is understood about why performance degrades across incomes or geographies. We take a step in this direction by annotating images from Dollar Street, a popular benchmark of geographically and economically diverse images, labeling each image with factors such as color, shape, and background. These anno- tations unlock a new granular view into how objects differ across incomes/regions. We then use these object differ- ences to pinpoint model vulnerabilities across incomes and regions. We study a range of modern vision models, find- ing that performance disparities are most associated with differences in texture, occlusion, and images with darker lighting. We illustrate how insights from our factor labels can surface mitigations to improve models\u2019 performance disparities. As an example, we show that mitigating a model\u2019s vulnerability to texture can improve performance on the lower income level.

We instead address the problem of semantic segmentation of nighttime images and improve the state-of-the-art, by adapting daytime models to nighttime without using night- time annotations. Moreover, we design a new evaluation framework to address the substantial uncertainty of seman- tics in nighttime images. Our central contributions are: 1) a curriculum framework to gradually adapt semantic segmen- tation models from day to night via labeled synthetic images and unlabeled real images, both for progressively darker times of day, which exploits cross-time-of-day correspon- dences for the real images to guide the inference of their labels; 2) a novel uncertainty-aware annotation and evalu- ation framework and metric for semantic segmentation, de- signed for adverse conditions and including image regions beyond human recognition capability in the evaluation in a principled fashion; 3) the Dark Zurich dataset, which com- prises 2416 unlabeled nighttime and 2920 unlabeled twi- light images with correspondences to their daytime coun- terparts plus a set of 151 nighttime images with fine pixel- level annotations created with our protocol, which serves as a first benchmark to perform our novel evaluation.

ATLANTIS consists of 5,195 images of waterbodies, as well as high quality pixel-level manual annotations of 56 classes of objects, including 17 classes of man-made objects, 18 classes of natural objects and 21 general classes. We analyze ATLANTIS in detail and evaluate several state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks on our benchmark. In addition, a novel deep neural network, AQUANet, is developed for waterbody semantic segmentation by processing the aquatic and non-aquatic regions in two different paths. AQUANet also incorporates low-level feature modulation and cross-path modula- tion for enhancing feature representation. Experimental results show that the proposed AQUANet outperforms other state-of-the-art semantic segmentation networks on ATLANTIS. We claim that ATLANTIS is the largest waterbody image dataset for semantic segmentation providing a wide range of water and water-related classes and it will benefit researchers of both computer vision and water resources engineering.Monocular depth estimation has experienced significant progress on terrestrial images in recent years, largely due to deep learning advancements.

The images are labeled pixel-wise for semantic segmentation task and questions are produced for the task of visual ques- tion answering. FloodNet poses several challenges includ- ing detection of flooded roads and buildings and distin- guishing between natural water and flooded water. With the advancement of deep learning algorithms, we can analyze the impact of any disaster which can make a precise under- standing of the affected areas. In this paper, we compare and contrast the performances of baseline methods for im- age classification, semantic segmentation, and visual ques- tion answering on our dataset.",

        "abstract": "Semantic segmentation has been one of the leading re- search interests in computer vision recently. It serves as a perception foundation for many fields, such as robotics and autonomous driving. The fast development of seman- tic segmentation attributes enormously to the large scale datasets, especially for the deep learning related methods. There already exist several semantic segmentation datasets for comparison among semantic segmentation methods in complex urban scenes, such as the Cityscapes and CamVid datasets, where the side views of the objects are captured with a camera mounted on the driving car. There also exist semantic labeling datasets for the airborne images and the satellite images, where the top views of the ob- jects are captured. However, only a few datasets capture urban scenes from an oblique Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) perspective, where both of the top view and the side view of the objects can be observed, providing more in- formation for object recognition. In this paper, we intro- duce our UAVid dataset, a new high-resolution UAV seman- tic segmentation dataset as a complement, which brings new challenges, including large scale variation, moving object recognition and temporal consistency preservation. Our UAV dataset consists of 30 video sequences captur- ing 4K high-resolution images in slanted views. In to- tal, 300 images have been densely labeled with 8 classes for the semantic labeling task. We have provided several deep learning baseline methods with pre-training, among which the proposed Multi-Scale-Dilation net performs the best via multi-scale feature extraction, reaching a mean intersection-over-union (IoU) score around 50% and out- performing the others by more than 1.6%. We have also ex- plored the influence of spatial-temporal regularization for sequence data by leveraging on feature space optimization (FSO) and 3D conditional random field (CRF), which im- proves the mean IoU scores by around another 0.5%.

        "abstract": "Nuclei instance segmentation plays an important role in the analysis of Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E)-stained images. While supervised deep learning (DL)-based approaches rep- resent the state-of-the-art in automatic nuclei instance seg- mentation, annotated datasets are required to train these mod- els. There are two main types of tissue processing protocols, namely formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded samples (FFPE) and frozen tissue samples (FS). Although FFPE-derived H&E stained tissue sections are the most widely used samples, H&E staining on frozen sections derived from FS samples is a relevant method in intra-operative surgical sessions as it can be performed fast. Due to differences in the protocols of these two types of samples, the derived images and in particular the nuclei appearance may be different in the acquired whole slide images. Analysis of FS-derived H&E stained images can be more challenging as rapid preparation, staining, and scanning of FS sections may lead to deterioration in image quality.\nIn this paper, we introduce CryoNuSeg, the first fully annotated FS-derived cryosectioned and H&E-stained nu- clei instance segmentation dataset. The dataset contains images from 10 human organs that were not exploited in other publicly available datasets, and is provided with three manual mark-ups to allow measuring intra-observer and inter- observer variability. Moreover, we investigate the effects of tissue fixation/embedding protocol (i.e., FS or FFPE) on the automatic nuclei instance segmentation performance of one of the state-of-the-art DL approaches. We also create a base- line segmentation benchmark for the dataset that can be used in future research.\nA step-by-step guide to generate the dataset as well as the full dataset and other detailed information are made avail- able to fellow researchers at https://github.com/ masih4/CryoNuSeg.\nIndex Terms\u2014 Medical Image Analysis, Computational Pathology, Nuclei Segmentation, H&E Staining, Frozen Tis-\nsue Samples, Deep Learning, Intra-Observer Variability, Inter-Observer Variability",

        "abstract": "In clinical radiology reports, doctors capture important information about the patient\u2019s health status. They convey their observations from raw medical imaging data about the inner structures of a patient. As such, formulating reports requires medical experts to possess wide-ranging knowledge about anatomical regions with their normal, healthy ap- pearance as well as the ability to recognize abnormalities. This explicit grasp on both the patient\u2019s anatomy and their appearance is missing in current medical image-processing systems as annotations are especially difficult to gather. This renders the models to be narrow experts e.g. for identifying specific diseases. In this work, we recover this miss- ing link by adding human anatomy into the mix and enable the association of content in medical reports to their occurrence in associated imagery (medical phrase grounding). To exploit anatomical structures in this scenario, we present a sophisticated automatic pipeline to gather and integrate human bodily structures from computed tomography datasets, which we incorporate in our PAXRAY: A Projected dataset for the segmenta- tion of Anatomical structures in X-RAY data.

At the heart of the problem are the inefficiencies of the waste sorting process (separating paper, plastic, metal, glass, etc.) due to the extremely complex and cluttered nature of the waste stream. Recyclable waste detection poses a unique computer vision challenge as it requires detection of highly deformable and often translucent objects in clut- tered scenes without the kind of context information usually present in human-centric datasets. This challenging com- puter vision task currently lacks suitable datasets or meth- ods in the available literature. In this paper, we take a step towards computer-aided waste detection and present the first in-the-wild industrial-grade waste detection and segmentation dataset, ZeroWaste.

Through exploring different mixing strategies for raw and generated captions, we outperform the best filtering method proposed by the DataComp benchmark by 2% on ImageNet and 4% on average across 38 tasks, given a candidate pool of 128M image-text pairs. Our best approach is also 2\u00d7 better at Flickr and MS-COCO retrieval. We then analyze what makes synthetic captions an effective source of text supervision. In experimenting with different image captioning models, we also demonstrate that the performance of a model on standard image captioning benchmarks (e.g., NoCaps CIDEr) is not a reliable indicator of the utility of the captions it generates for multimodal training. Finally, our experiments with using generated captions at DataComp\u2019s large scale (1.28B image-text pairs) offer insights into the limitations of synthetic text, as well as the importance of image curation with increasing training data quantity.

Thus, accurately understanding customer preferences is essential for providing personalized recommendations. Session-based recommendation, which utilizes customer session data to predict their next interaction, has become increasingly popular. However, existing session datasets have limitations in terms of item attributes, user diversity, and dataset scale. As a result, they cannot comprehensively capture the spectrum of user behaviors and preferences. To bridge this gap, we present the Amazon Multilingual Multi- locale Shopping Session Dataset, namely Amazon-M2. It is the first multilingual dataset consisting of millions of user sessions from six different locales, where the major languages of products are English, German, Japanese, French, Italian, and Spanish.

However, the promising results are mainly shown by the qualitative cases of generated videos, while the quantitative evaluation of T2V models still faces two critical problems. Firstly, existing studies lack fine-grained evaluation of T2V models on different categories of text prompts. Although some bench- marks have categorized the prompts, their categorization either only focuses on a single aspect or fails to consider the temporal information in video generation. Secondly, it is unclear whether the automatic evaluation metrics are consistent with human standards. To address these problems, we propose FETV, a benchmark for Fine-grained Evaluation of Text-to-Video generation. FETV is multi-aspect, categorizing the prompts based on three orthogonal aspects: the major content, the attributes to control and the prompt complexity. FETV is also temporal-aware, which introduces several temporal categories tailored for video generation. Based on FETV, we conduct comprehensive manual evaluations of four representative T2V models, revealing their pros and cons on different categories of prompts from different aspects. We also extend FETV as a testbed to evaluate the re- liability of automatic T2V metrics. The multi-aspect categorization of FETV enables fine-grained analysis of the metrics\u2019 reliability in different scenarios. We find that existing automatic metrics (e.g., CLIPScore and FVD) correlate poorly with human evaluation. To address this problem, we explore several solutions to improve CLIPScore and FVD, and develop two automatic metrics that exhibit significant higher correlation with humans than existing metrics.

Addressing this oversight, we introduce a comprehensive robustness test suite, RoboDepth, encompassing 18 corruptions spanning three categories: i) weather and lighting conditions; ii) sensor failures and movement; and iii) data processing anomalies. We subsequently benchmark 42 depth estimation models across indoor and outdoor scenes to assess their resilience to these corruptions. Our findings underscore that, in the absence of a dedicated robustness evaluation framework, many leading depth estimation models may be susceptible to typical corruptions. We delve into design considerations for crafting more robust depth estimation models, touching upon pre-training, augmentation, modality, model capacity, and learning paradigms. We anticipate our benchmark will establish a foundational platform for advancing robust OoD depth estimation.",

        "abstract": "The application of deep learning to nursing procedure activity understanding has the potential to greatly enhance the quality and safety of nurse-patient interactions. By utilizing the technique, we can facilitate training and education, improve quality control, and enable operational compliance monitoring. However, the development of automatic recognition systems in this field is currently hindered by the scarcity of appropriately labeled datasets. The existing video datasets pose several limitations: 1) these datasets are small-scale in size to support comprehensive investigations of nursing activity; 2) they primarily focus on single procedures, lacking expert- level annotations for various nursing procedures and action steps; and 3) they lack temporally localized annotations, which prevents the effective localization of targeted actions within longer video sequences. To mitigate these limitations, we propose NurViD, a large video dataset with expert-level annotation for nursing procedure activity understanding. NurViD consists of over 1.5k videos totaling 144 hours, making it approximately four times longer than the existing largest nursing activity datasets. Notably, it encompasses 51 distinct nursing procedures and 177 action steps, providing a much more comprehensive coverage compared to existing datasets that primarily focus on limited procedures. To evaluate the efficacy of current deep learning methods on nursing activity understanding, we establish three benchmarks on NurViD: procedure recognition on untrimmed videos, procedure and action recognition on trimmed videos, and action detection.

In this work, we investigate scaling up EHPS towards the first generalist foundation model (dubbed SMPLer-X), with up to ViT-Huge as the backbone and training with up to 4.5M instances from diverse data sources. With big data and the large model, SMPLer-X exhibits strong performance across diverse test benchmarks and excellent transferability to even unseen environments. 1) For the data scaling, we perform a systematic investigation on 32 EHPS datasets, including a wide range of scenarios that a model trained on any single dataset cannot handle. More importantly, capitalizing on insights obtained from the extensive benchmarking process, we optimize our training scheme and select datasets that lead to a significant leap in EHPS capabilities. 2) For the model scaling, we take advantage of vision transformers to study the scaling law of model sizes in EHPS. Moreover, our finetuning strategy turn SMPLer-X into specialist models, allowing them to achieve further performance boosts. Notably, our foundation model SMPLer-X consistently delivers state-of-the-art results on seven benchmarks such as AGORA (107.2 mm NMVE), UBody (57.4 mm PVE), EgoBody (63.6 mm PVE), and EHF (62.3 mm PVE without finetuning).",

        "abstract": "Given the widespread adoption of depth-sensing acquisition devices, RGB-D videos and related data/media have gained considerable traction in various aspects of daily life. Consequently, conducting salient object detection (SOD) in RGB- D videos presents a highly promising and evolving avenue. Despite the potential of this area, SOD in RGB-D videos remains somewhat under-explored, with RGB-D SOD and video SOD (VSOD) traditionally studied in isolation. To explore this emerging field, this paper makes two primary contributions: the dataset and the model. On one front, we construct the RDVS dataset, a new RGB-D VSOD dataset with realistic depth and characterized by its diversity of scenes and rigorous frame- by-frame annotations. We validate the dataset through com- prehensive attribute and object-oriented analyses, and provide training and testing splits. Moreover, we introduce DCTNet+, a three-stream network tailored for RGB-D VSOD, with an emphasis on RGB modality and treats depth and optical flow as auxiliary modalities. In pursuit of effective feature enhancement, refinement, and fusion for precise final prediction, we propose two modules: the multi-modal attention module (MAM) and the refinement fusion module (RFM). To enhance interaction and fusion within RFM, we design a universal interaction module (UIM) and then integrate holistic multi-modal attentive paths (HMAPs) for refining multi-modal low-level features be- fore reaching RFMs. Comprehensive experiments, conducted on pseudo RGB-D video datasets alongside our proposed RDVS, highlight the superiority of DCTNet+ over 17 VSOD models and 14 RGB-D SOD models. Additionally, insightful ablation experiments were performed on both pseudo and realistic RGB- D video datasets to demonstrate the advantages of individual modules as well as the necessity of introducing realistic depth into VSOD.

        "abstract": "Compositional reasoning is a hallmark of human visual intelligence. Yet despite the size of large vision-language models, they struggle to represent simple com- positions by combining objects with their attributes. To measure this lack of compositional capability, we design Cola, a text-to-image retrieval benchmark to Compose Objects Localized with Attributes. To solve Cola, a model must retrieve images with the correct configuration of attributes and objects, and avoid choosing a distractor image with the same objects and attributes but in the wrong configuration. Cola contains about 1.2k composed queries of 168 objects and 197 attributes on around 30K images. Our human evaluation finds that Cola is 83.33% accurate, similar to contemporary compositionality benchmarks. Using Cola as a testbed, we explore empirical modeling designs to adapt pre-trained vision-language models to reason compositionally. We explore 6 adaptation strate- gies on 2 seminal vision-language models, using compositionality-centric test benchmarks - Cola and CREPE. We find the optimal adaptation strategy is to train a multi-modal attention layer that jointly attends over the frozen pre-trained image and language features. Surprisingly, training multimodal layers on CLIP performs better than tuning a larger FLAVA model with already pre-trained multi- modal layers. Furthermore, our adaptation strategy improves CLIP and FLAVA to comparable levels, suggesting that training multimodal layers using contrastive attribute-object data is key, as opposed to using them pre-trained. Lastly, we show that Cola is harder than a closely-related contemporary benchmark, CREPE, since simpler fine-tuning strategies without multimodal layers suffice on CREPE, but not on Cola. However, we still see a significant gap between our best adaptation and human accuracy, suggesting considerable room for further research.

Investigating how human drivers react differently when following autonomous vs. human-driven vehicles (HV) is thus critical for mixed traffic flow. Research in this field can be expedited with trajectory datasets collected by Autonomous Vehicles (AVs). However, trajectories collected by AVs are noisy and not readily applicable for studying CF behaviour. This paper extracts and enhances two categories of CF data, HV-following-AV (H-A) and HV-following-HV (H-H), from the open Lyft level-5 dataset. First, CF pairs are selected based on specific rules. Next, the quality of raw data is assessed by anomaly analysis. Then, the raw CF data is corrected and enhanced via motion planning, Kalman filtering, and wavelet denoising. As a result, 29k+ H-A and 42k+ H-H car-following segments are obtained, with a total driving distance of 150k+ km. A diversity assessment shows that the processed data cover complete CF regimes for calibrating CF models. This open and ready-to-use dataset provides the opportunity to investigate the CF behaviours of following AVs vs. HVs from real-world data. It can further facilitate studies on exploring the impact of AVs on mixed urban traffic.\nIndex Terms\u2014 Car-following, trajectory dataset, autonomous vehicle, driving behaviour",

While there is a growing body of ML-based motion plan- ners, the lack of established datasets and metrics has limited the progress in this area. Existing benchmarks for autonomous vehicle motion prediction have focused on short-term motion forecasting, rather than long-term planning. This has led previous works to use open-loop evaluation with L2-based metrics, which are not suitable for fairly evaluating long-term planning. Our bench- mark overcomes these limitations by introducing a large- scale driving dataset, lightweight closed-loop simulator, and motion-planning-specific metrics. We provide a high- quality dataset with 1500h of human driving data from 4 cities across the US and Asia with widely varying traffic pat- terns (Boston, Pittsburgh, Las Vegas and Singapore). We will provide a closed-loop simulation framework with re- active agents and provide a large set of both general and scenario-specific planning metrics. We plan to release the dataset at NeurIPS 2021 and organize benchmark chal- lenges starting in early 2022.",

        "abstract": "Building agents based on tree-search planning capabilities with learned models has achieved remarkable success in classic decision-making problems, such as Go and Atari. However, it has been deemed challenging or even infeasible to extend Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) based algorithms to diverse real-world applications, especially when these environments involve complex action spaces and significant simulation costs, or inherent stochasticity. In this work, we introduce LightZero, the first unified benchmark for deploying MCTS/MuZero in general sequential decision scenarios. Specificially, we summarize the most critical challenges in designing a general MCTS-style decision-making solver, then decompose the tightly-coupled algorithm and system design of tree-search RL methods into distinct sub-modules. By incorporating more appropriate exploration and optimization strategies, we can significantly enhance these sub-modules and construct powerful LightZero agents to tackle tasks across a wide range of domains, such as board games, Atari, MuJoCo, MiniGrid and GoBigger. Detailed benchmark results reveal the significant potential of such methods in building scalable and efficient decision intelligence.

Methods designed to retrieve whole video clips with natural language determine what occurs in a video but not when. To address this issue, we propose the Mo- ment Context Network (MCN) which effectively localizes natural language queries in videos by integrating local and global video features over time. A key obstacle to train- ing our MCN model is that current video datasets do not include pairs of localized video segments and referring ex- pressions, or text descriptions which uniquely identify a corresponding moment. Therefore, we collect the Distinct Describable Moments (DiDeMo) dataset which consists of over 10,000 unedited, personal videos in diverse visual set- tings with pairs of localized video segments and referring expressions. We demonstrate that MCN outperforms sev- eral baseline methods and believe that our initial results together with the release of DiDeMo will inspire further re- search on localizing video moments with natural language.",

One of the challenges in pursuing this direction is the lack of annotated data. To address this issue, we present the Query-based Video Highlights (QVHIGHLIGHTS) dataset. It consists of over 10,000 YouTube videos, covering a wide range of topics, from everyday activities and travel in lifestyle vlog videos to social and political activities in news videos. Each video in the dataset is annotated with: (1) a human-written free-form NL query, (2) relevant moments in the video w.r.t. the query, and (3) five-point scale saliency scores for all query-relevant clips. This comprehensive annotation enables us to develop and evaluate systems that detect relevant moments as well as salient highlights for diverse, flexible user queries. We also present a strong baseline for this task, Moment-DETR, a transformer encoder-decoder model that views moment retrieval as a direct set prediction problem, taking extracted video and query representations as inputs and predicting moment coordinates and saliency scores end-to-end. While our model does not utilize any human prior, we show that it performs competitively when compared to well-engineered architectures.

        "abstract": "Explainable recommendation has attracted much attention from the industry and academic communities. It has shown great potential for improving the recommendation persuasiveness, informative- ness and user satisfaction. Despite a lot of promising explainable recommender models have been proposed in the past few years, the evaluation strategies of these models suffer from several limitations. For example, the explanation ground truths are not labeled by real users, the explanations are mostly evaluated based on only one as- pect and the evaluation strategies can be hard to unify. To alleviate the above problems, we propose to build an explainable recommen- dation dataset with multi-aspect real user labeled ground truths. In specific, we firstly develop a video recommendation platform, where a series of questions around the recommendation explainabil- ity are carefully designed. Then, we recruit about 3000 users with different backgrounds to use the system, and collect their behaviors and feedback to our questions. In this paper, we detail the con- struction process of our dataset and also provide extensive analysis on its characteristics. In addition, we develop a library, where ten well-known explainable recommender models are implemented in a unified framework. Based on this library, we build several bench- marks for different explainable recommendation tasks. At last, we present many new opportunities brought by our dataset, which are expected to shed some new lights to the explainable recommenda- tion field.

Detailed simulation frameworks such as the gold standard GEANT4 are computationally intensive, and current deep generative architectures work on discretized, lower resolution versions of the detailed simula- tion. The development of models that work at higher spatial resolutions is currently hindered by the complexity of the full simulation data, and by the lack of simpler, more interpretable benchmarks. Our contribution is SUPA, the SUrrogate PArticle propagation simulator, an algorithm and software package for generating data by simulating simplified particle propagation, scattering and shower development in matter. The generation is extremely fast and easy to use compared to GEANT4, but still exhibits the key characteristics and challenges of the detailed simulation. The proposed simulator generates thousands of particle showers per second on a desktop machine, a speed up of up to 6 orders of magnitudes over GEANT4, and stores detailed geometric information about the shower propagation. SUPA provides much greater flexibility for setting initial conditions and defining multi- ple benchmarks for the development of models. Moreover, interpreting particle showers as point clouds creates a connection to geometric machine learning and provides challenging and fundamentally new datasets for the field.",

        "abstract": "The distillation of ranking models has become an important topic in both academia and industry. In recent years, several advanced methods have been proposed to tackle this problem, often leveraging ranking information from teacher rankers that is absent in traditional classification settings.

Moreover, in- consistent benchmarking on a wide range of tasks and datasets make it difficult to assess or invigorate advances in this field. This paper first examines represen- tative prior arts on ranking distillation, and raises three questions to be answered around methodology and reproducibility. To that end, we propose a systematic and unified benchmark, Ranking Distillation Suite (RD-Suite), which is a collection of tasks with 4 large real-world datasets, encompassing two major modalities (textual and numeric) and two applications (standard distillation and distillation transfer). RD-Suite consists of benchmark results that challenge some of the common wis- dom in the field, and the release of datasets with teacher scores and evaluation scripts for future research. RD-Suite paves the way towards better understanding of ranking distillation, facilities more research in this direction, and presents new challenges.",

        "abstract": "Accurate Urban SpatioTemporal Prediction (USTP) is of great importance to the development and operation of the smart city. As an emerging building block, multi-sourced urban data are usually integrated as urban knowledge graphs (Ur- banKGs) to provide critical knowledge for urban spatiotemporal prediction models. However, existing UrbanKGs are often tailored for specific downstream prediction tasks and are not publicly available, which limits the potential advancement. This paper presents UUKG, the unified urban knowledge graph dataset for knowledge- enhanced urban spatiotemporal predictions. Specifically, we first construct Ur- banKGs consisting of millions of triplets for two metropolises by connecting heterogeneous urban entities such as administrative boroughs, POIs, and road seg- ments. Moreover, we conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis on constructed UrbanKGs and uncover diverse high-order structural patterns, such as hierarchies and cycles, that can be leveraged to benefit downstream USTP tasks. To validate and facilitate the use of UrbanKGs, we implement and evaluate 15 KG embedding methods on the KG completion task and integrate the learned KG embeddings into 9 spatiotemporal models for five different USTP tasks. The extensive experimental results not only provide benchmarks of knowledge-enhanced USTP models under different task settings but also highlight the potential of state-of-the-art high-order structure-aware UrbanKG embedding methods. We hope the proposed UUKG fosters research on urban knowledge graphs and broad smart city applications. The dataset and source code are available at https://github.com/usail-hkust/UUKG/",

Current MCBO papers often introduce non-diverse or non-standard benchmarks to evaluate their methods, impeding the proper assessment of different MCBO primitives and their combinations. Addi- tionally, papers introducing a solution for a single MCBO primitive often omit benchmarking against baselines that utilize the same methods for the remaining primitives [1\u20134]. This omission is primarily due to the significant implementation overhead involved, resulting in a lack of controlled assessments and an inability to showcase the merits of a contribution effectively. To overcome these chal- lenges, our proposed framework enables an effortless combination of Bayesian Optimization components, and provides a diverse set of synthetic and real-world benchmarking tasks. Leveraging this flexibility, we implement 47 novel MCBO algorithms and benchmark them against seven existing MCBO solvers and five standard black-box optimization algorithms on ten tasks, conducting over 4000 experiments. Our findings reveal a superior combination of MCBO primitives outperforming existing approaches and illustrate the significance of model fit and the use of a trust region.

Recently, Language Models (LMs) have demonstrated complex reasoning capacities even without any finetuning. However, existing evaluation for automated reasoning assumes access to a consistent and coherent set of information over which models reason. When reasoning in the real-world, the available information is frequently inconsistent or contradictory, and therefore models need to be equipped with a strategy to resolve such conflicts when they arise. One widely-applicable way of resolving conflicts is to impose preferences over information sources (e.g., based on source credibility or information recency) and adopt the source with higher preference. In this paper, we formulate the problem of reasoning with contradictory information guided by preferences over sources as the classical problem of defeasible reasoning, and develop a dataset called BoardgameQA for measuring the reasoning capacity of LMs in this setting. BoardgameQA also incorporates reasoning with implicit background knowledge, to better reflect reasoning problems in downstream applications. We benchmark various LMs on BoardgameQA and the results reveal a significant gap in the reasoning capacity of state-of-the-art LMs on this problem, showing that reasoning with conflicting information does not surface out-of-the-box in LMs. While performance can be improved with finetuning, it nevertheless remains poor.",

One major reason is that current InsDet datasets are too small in scale by today\u2019s standards.

Our understand- ing has significantly improved over the last decades with the advent of satellite remote sensing data, allowing us to capture essential sea surface quantities over the globe, e.g., sea surface height (SSH). Despite their ever-increasing abundance, ocean satellite data presents challenges for information extraction due to their sparsity and irregular sampling, signal complexity, and noise. Machine learning (ML) techniques have demonstrated their capabilities in dealing with large-scale, complex signals. Therefore we see an opportunity for these ML models to har- ness the full extent of the information contained in ocean satellite data. However, data representation and relevant evaluation metrics can be the defining factors when determining the success of applied ML. The processing steps from the raw observation data to a ML-ready state and from model outputs to interpretable quantities require domain expertise, which can be a significant barrier to entry for ML researchers. In addition, imposing fixed processing steps, like committing to specific variables, regions, and geometries, will narrow the scope of ML models and their potential impact on real-world applications. OceanBench is a unifying framework that provides standardized processing steps that comply with domain- expert standards. It is designed with a flexible and pedagogical abstraction: it a) provides plug-and-play data and pre-configured pipelines for ML researchers to benchmark their models w.r.t. ML and domain-related baselines and b) provides a transparent and configurable framework for researchers to customize and extend the pipeline for their tasks.

Our experiments un- cover the strengths and weaknesses of state-of-the-art meth- ods, showing that extra efforts are needed for them to per- form in such diverse scenarios. RenderMe-360 opens the door for future exploration in modern head avatars. All of the data, code, and models will be publicly available at https://RenderMe-360.github.io/.",

        "abstract": "Evaluating large language model (LLM) based chat assistants is challenging due to their broad capabilities and the inadequacy of existing benchmarks in measuring human preferences. To address this, we explore using strong LLMs as judges to evaluate these models on more open-ended questions. We examine the usage and limitations of LLM-as-a-judge, including position, verbosity, and self-enhancement biases, as well as limited reasoning ability, and propose solutions to mitigate some of them. We then verify the agreement between LLM judges and human preferences by introducing two benchmarks: MT-bench, a multi-turn question set; and Chatbot Arena, a crowdsourced battle platform. Our results reveal that strong LLM judges like GPT-4 can match both controlled and crowdsourced human preferences well, achieving over 80% agreement, the same level of agreement between humans. Hence, LLM-as-a-judge is a scalable and explainable way to approximate human preferences, which are otherwise very expensive to obtain. Additionally, we show our benchmark and traditional benchmarks complement each other by evaluating several variants of LLaMA and Vicuna. The MT-bench questions, 3K expert votes, and 30K conversations with human preferences are publicly available at https: //github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/tree/main/fastchat/llm_judge.",

        "abstract": "The extraordinary ability of generative models to generate photographic images has intensified concerns about the spread of disinformation, thereby leading to the demand for detectors capable of distinguishing between AI-generated fake images and real images. However, the lack of large datasets containing images from the most advanced image generators poses an obstacle to the development of such detectors. In this paper, we introduce the GenImage dataset, which has the following advantages: 1) Plenty of Images, including over one million pairs of AI-generated fake images and collected real images. 2) Rich Image Content, encompassing a broad range of image classes. 3) State-of-the-art Generators, synthesizing images with advanced diffusion models and GANs. The aforemen- tioned advantages allow the detectors trained on GenImage to undergo a thorough evaluation and demonstrate strong applicability to diverse images. We conduct a comprehensive analysis of the dataset and propose two tasks for evaluating the detection method in resembling real-world scenarios. The cross-generator image classification task measures the performance of a detector trained on one generator when tested on the others. The degraded image classification task assesses the capa- bility of the detectors in handling degraded images such as low-resolution, blurred, and compressed images. With the GenImage dataset, researchers can effectively expedite the development and evaluation of superior AI-generated image detectors in comparison to prevailing methodologies.",

In IMP, a multi-component engineering system is subject to a risk of failure due to its components\u2019 damage con- dition. Specifically, each agent plans inspections and repairs for a specific system component, aiming to minimise maintenance costs while cooperating to minimise system failure risk. With IMP-MARL, we release several environments including one related to offshore wind structural systems, in an effort to meet today\u2019s needs to improve management strategies to support sustainable and reliable energy systems. Supported by IMP practical engineering environments featuring up to 100 agents, we conduct a benchmark campaign, where the scalability and performance of state-of-the-art cooperative MARL methods are compared against expert-based heuristic policies. The results reveal that centralised training with decentralised execution methods scale better with the number of agents than fully centralised or decentralised RL approaches, while also outperforming expert-based heuristic policies in most IMP environments. Based on our findings, we additionally out- line remaining cooperation and scalability challenges that future MARL methods should still address. Through IMP-MARL, we encourage the implementation of new environments and the further development of MARL methods.",

We use a linear assignment algorithm to place images into longer bodies of text using CLIP features [24], a process that we show outperforms alternatives. mmc4 spans everyday topics like cooking, travel, technology, etc. A manual inspection of a random sample of documents shows that a vast majority (88%) of images are topically relevant, and that linear assignment frequently selects individual sentences specifically well-aligned with each image (80%).

        "abstract": "We introduce WordScape, a novel pipeline for the creation of cross-disciplinary, multilingual corpora comprising millions of pages with annotations for document layout detection. Relating visual and textual items on document pages has gained further significance with the advent of multimodal models. Various approaches proved effective for visual question answering or layout segmentation. However, the interplay of text, tables, and visuals remains challenging for a variety of document understanding tasks. In particular, many models fail to generalize well to diverse domains and new languages due to insufficient availability of training data. WordScape addresses these limitations. Our automatic annotation pipeline parses the Open XML structure of Word documents obtained from the web, jointly providing layout-annotated document images and their textual representations. In turn, WordScape offers unique properties as it (1) leverages the ubiquity of the Word file format on the internet, (2) is readily accessible through the Common Crawl web corpus, (3) is adaptive to domain-specific documents, and (4) offers culturally and linguistically diverse document pages with natural semantic structure and high-quality text. Together with the pipeline, we will additionally release 9.5M urls to word documents which can be processed using WordScape to create a dataset of over 40M pages. Finally, we investigate the quality of text and layout annotations extracted by WordScape, assess the impact on document understanding benchmarks, and demonstrate that manual labeling costs can be substantially reduced.",

Our approach first generates synthetic segmentation masks, subsequently used as conditions for the high-fidelity generative diffusion process.

Moreover, it can be parallelized more efficiently than previous large-content generation methods while avoiding tiling artifacts. The training leverages classifier-free guidance to augment a small, sparsely an- notated dataset with unlabelled data. Our method alleviates unique challenges in histopathological imaging practice: large-scale information, costly manual anno- tation, and protective data handling. The biological plausibility of DiffInfinite data is evaluated in a survey by ten experienced pathologists as well as a downstream classification and segmentation task. Samples from the model score strongly on anti-copying metrics which is relevant for the protection of patient data",

        "abstract": "Lifelong learning offers a promising paradigm of building a generalist agent that learns and adapts over its lifespan. Unlike traditional lifelong learning problems in image and text domains, which primarily involve the transfer of declarative knowl- edge of entities and concepts, lifelong learning in decision-making (LLDM) also necessitates the transfer of procedural knowledge, such as actions and behaviors. To advance research in LLDM, we introduce LIBERO, a novel benchmark of lifelong learning for robot manipulation. Specifically, LIBERO highlights five key research topics in LLDM: 1) how to efficiently transfer declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge, or the mixture of both; 2) how to design effective policy architectures and 3) effective algorithms for LLDM; 4) the robustness of a lifelong learner with respect to task ordering; and 5) the effect of model pretraining for LLDM. We develop an extendible procedural generation pipeline that can in principle generate infinitely many tasks. For benchmarking purpose, we create four task suites (130 tasks in total) that we use to investigate the above-mentioned research topics. To support sample-efficient learning, we provide high-quality human-teleoperated demonstration data for all tasks. Our extensive experiments present several insightful or even unexpected discoveries: sequential finetuning outperforms existing lifelong learning methods in forward transfer, no single visual encoder architecture excels at all types of knowledge transfer, and naive supervised pretraining can hinder agents\u2019 performance in the subsequent LLDM",

In contrast to formal mathematics, where large databases of formal proofs are available (e.g., the Lean Mathematical Library), current datasets of natural-language mathematics, used to benchmark language models, either cover only elementary mathematics or are very small. We address this by publicly releasing two new datasets: GHOSTS and miniGHOSTS. These are the first natural-language datasets curated by working researchers in mathematics that (1) aim to cover graduate-level mathematics, (2) provide a holistic overview of the mathematical capabilities of language models, and (3) distinguish multiple dimensions of mathematical reasoning. These datasets also test whether ChatGPT and GPT-4 can be helpful assistants to professional mathematicians by emulating use cases that arise in the daily professional activities of mathematicians. We benchmark the models on a range of fine-grained performance metrics. For advanced mathematics, this is the most detailed evaluation effort to date. We find that ChatGPT can be used most successfully as a mathematical assistant for querying facts, acting as a mathematical search engine and knowledge base interface. GPT-4 can additionally be used for undergraduate-level mathematics but fails on graduate-level difficulty. Contrary to many positive reports in the media about GPT-4 and ChatGPT\u2019s exam-solving abilities (a potential case of selection bias), their overall mathematical performance is well below the level of a graduate student. Hence, if your goal is to use ChatGPT to pass a graduate-level math exam, you would be better off copying from your average peer!",

        "abstract": "In this work we explore recent advances in instruction-tuning language models on a range of open instruction-following datasets. Despite recent claims that open models can be on par with state-of-the-art proprietary models, these claims are often accompanied by limited evaluation, making it difficult to compare models across the board and determine the utility of various resources. We provide a large set of instruction-tuned models from 6.7B to 65B parameters in size, trained on 12 instruc- tion datasets ranging from manually curated (e.g., OpenAssistant) to synthetic and distilled (e.g., Alpaca) and systematically evaluate them on their factual knowledge, reasoning, multilinguality, coding, safety, and open-ended instruction following abilities through a collection of automatic, model-based, and human-based metrics. We further introduce T\u00dcLU , our best performing instruction-tuned model suite finetuned on a combination of high-quality open resources.\nOur experiments show that different instruction-tuning datasets can uncover or enhance specific skills, while no single dataset (or combination) provides the best performance across all evaluations. Interestingly, we find that model and human preference-based evaluations fail to reflect differences in model capabilities exposed by benchmark-based evaluations, suggesting the need for the type of systemic evaluation performed in this work. Our evaluations show that the best model in any given evaluation reaches on average 87% of ChatGPT performance, and 73% of GPT-4 performance, suggesting that further investment in building better base models and instruction-tuning data is required to close the gap. We release our instruction-tuned models, including a fully finetuned 65B T\u00dcLU , along with our code, data, and evaluation framework to facilitate future research.",

Variations in the positions of objects in a room can effect measurable changes in the room\u2019s acoustic properties, as characterized by the RIR. Existing datasets of RIRs either do not systematically vary positions of objects in an environment, or they consist of only simulated RIRs. We present SOUNDCAM, the largest dataset of unique RIRs from in-the-wild rooms publicly released to date.1 It includes 5,000 10-channel real-world measurements of room impulse responses and 2,000 10-channel recordings of music in three different rooms, including a controlled acoustic lab, an in-the-wild living room, and a conference room, with different humans in positions throughout each room.

Due to the nature of evolving graph structures into the training process, vanilla GNNs usually fail to scale up, limited by the GPU memory space. Up to now, though numerous scalable GNN architectures have been proposed, we still lack a comprehensive survey and fair benchmark of this reservoir to find the rationale for designing scalable GNNs. To this end, we first systematically formulate the representative methods of large-scale graph training into several branches and further establish a fair and consistent bench- mark for them by a greedy hyperparameter searching. In addition, regarding efficiency, we theoretically evaluate the time and space complexity of various branches and empirically compare them w.r.t GPU memory usage, through- put, and convergence. Furthermore, We analyze the pros and cons for various branches of scalable GNNs and then present a new ensembling training man- ner, named EnGCN, to address the existing issues.

To fill this gap, we collect comprehensive human an- notations on three existing datasets, and introduce StoryBench: a new, challenging multi-task benchmark to reliably evaluate forthcoming text-to-video models. Our benchmark includes three video generation tasks of increasing difficulty: action execution, where the next action must be generated starting from a conditioning video; story continuation, where a sequence of actions must be executed starting from a conditioning video; and story generation, where a video must be generated from only text prompts. We evaluate small yet strong text-to-video baselines, and show the benefits of training on story-like data algorithmically generated from existing video captions. Finally, we establish guidelines for human evaluation of video stories, and reaffirm the need of better automatic metrics for video generation.

        "abstract": "Annotating medical images, particularly for organ segmentation, is laborious and time-consuming. For example, annotating an abdominal organ requires an estimated rate of 30\u201360 minutes per CT volume based on the expertise of an annotator and the size, visibility, and complexity of the organ. Therefore, publicly available datasets for multi-organ segmentation are often limited in data size and organ diversity. This paper proposes an active learning procedure to expedite the annotation process for organ segmentation and creates the largest multi-organ dataset (by far) with the spleen, liver, kidneys, stomach, gallbladder, pancreas, aorta, and IVC annotated in 8,448 CT volumes, equating to 3.2 million slices. The conventional annotation methods would take an experienced annotator up to 1,600 weeks (or roughly 30.8 years) to complete this task. In contrast, our annotation procedure has accomplished this task in three weeks (based on an 8-hour workday, five days a week) while maintaining a similar or even better annotation quality. This achievement is attributed to three unique properties of our method: (1) label bias reduction using multiple pre-trained segmentation models, (2) effective error detection in the model predictions, and (3) attention guidance for annotators to make corrections on the most salient errors. Furthermore, we summarize the taxonomy of common errors made by AI algorithms and annotators. This allows for continuous improvement of AI and annotations, significantly reducing the annotation costs required to create large-scale datasets for a wider variety of medical imaging tasks.",

We find that the distribution shift settings in previous studies com- monly lack adequate challenges, hindering the accurate evaluation of OOD robust- ness. To address these issues, we propose a benchmark construction protocol that ensures clear differentiation and challenging distribution shifts. Then we introduce BOSS, a Benchmark suite for Out-of-distribution robustneSS evaluation covering 5 tasks and 20 datasets. Based on BOSS, we conduct a series of experiments on pre- trained language models for analysis and evaluation of OOD robustness. First, for vanilla fine-tuning, we examine the relationship between in-distribution (ID) and OOD performance. We identify three typical types that unveil the inner learning mechanism, which could potentially facilitate the forecasting of OOD robustness, correlating with the advancements on ID datasets. Then, we evaluate 5 classic meth- ods on BOSS and find that, despite exhibiting some effectiveness in specific cases, they do not offer significant improvement compared to vanilla fine-tuning. Further, we evaluate 5 LLMs with various adaptation paradigms and find that when sufficient ID data is available, fine-tuning domain-specific models outperform LLMs on ID examples significantly. However, in the case of OOD instances, prioritizing LLMs with in-context learning yields better results. We identify that both fine-tuned small models and LLMs face challenges in effectively addressing downstream tasks. The code is public at https://github.com/lifan-yuan/OOD_NLP.",

Such over-reliance on spurious correlations also causes systems to struggle with detecting implicitly toxic lan- guage. To help mitigate these issues, we cre- ate TOXIGEN, a new large-scale and machine- generated dataset of 274k toxic and benign statements about 13 minority groups. We de- velop a demonstration-based prompting frame- work and an adversarial classifier-in-the-loop decoding method to generate subtly toxic and benign text with a massive pretrained language model (Brown et al., 2020). Controlling ma- chine generation in this way allows TOXIGEN to cover implicitly toxic text at a larger scale, and about more demographic groups, than pre- vious resources of human-written text. We conduct a human evaluation on a challeng- ing subset of TOXIGEN and find that annota- tors struggle to distinguish machine-generated text from human-written language. We also find that 94.5% of toxic examples are labeled as hate speech by human annotators. Using three publicly-available datasets, we show that finetuning a toxicity classifier on our data im- proves its performance on human-written data substantially. We also demonstrate that TOXI- GEN can be used to fight machine-generated toxicity as finetuning improves the classifier significantly on our evaluation subset.

        "abstract": "Hate speech has grown significantly on social media, causing serious consequences for vic- tims of all demographics. Despite much at- tention being paid to characterize and detect discriminatory speech, most work has focused on explicit or overt hate speech, failing to ad- dress a more pervasive form based on coded or indirect language. To fill this gap, this work introduces a theoretically-justified taxon- omy of implicit hate speech and a benchmark corpus with fine-grained labels for each mes- sage and its implication. We present system- atic analyses of our dataset using contempo- rary baselines to detect and explain implicit hate speech, and we discuss key features that challenge existing models. This dataset will continue to serve as a useful benchmark for un- derstanding this multifaceted issue. To down- load the data, see https://github.com/ GT-SALT/implicit-hate",

We introduce a novel approach for dataset creation based on worker and AI collabo- ration, which brings together the generative strength of language models and the evaluative strength of humans. Starting with an existing dataset, MultiNLI for natural language infer- ence (NLI), our approach uses dataset cartog- raphy to automatically identify examples that demonstrate challenging reasoning patterns, and instructs GPT-3 to compose new exam- ples with similar patterns. Machine generated examples are then automatically filtered, and finally revised and labeled by human crowd- workers. The resulting dataset, WANLI, con- sists of 107,885 NLI examples and presents unique empirical strengths over existing NLI datasets. Remarkably, training a model on WANLI improves performance on eight out- of-domain test sets we consider, including by 11% on HANS and 9% on Adversarial NLI, compared to training on the 4\u00d7 larger MultiNLI. Moreover, it continues to be more effective than MultiNLI augmented with other NLI datasets.

To address this issue, we present a comprehensive relabeling effort assisted by automatic consistency checking that corrects 7.0% of all labels in the English CoNLL-03. Our effort adds a layer of entity linking annota- tion both for better explainability of NER labels and as additional safeguard of annotation qual- ity.

For these scientific prob- lems, molecules serve as the fundamental building blocks, and machine learning has emerged as a highly effective and powerful tool for modeling their geometric structures. Nevertheless, due to the rapidly evolving process of the field and the knowledge gap between science (e.g., physics, chemistry, & biology) and machine learning communities, a benchmarking study on geometrical representation for such data has not been conducted. To address such an issue, in this paper, we first provide a unified view of the current symmetry-informed geometric methods, classifying them into three main categories: invariance, equivariance with spherical frame basis, and equivariance with vector frame basis. Then we propose a platform, coined Geom3D, which enables benchmarking the effectiveness of geometric strategies. Geom3D contains 16 advanced symmetry-informed geometric repre- sentation models and 14 geometric pretraining methods over 46 diverse datasets, including small molecules, proteins, and crystalline materials. We hope that Geom3D can, on the one hand, eliminate barriers for machine learning researchers interested in exploring scientific problems; and, on the other hand, provide valuable guidance for researchers in computational chemistry, structural biology, and materials science, aiding in the informed selection of representation techniques for specific applications.

Despite the ubiquity of these graphs in real-world scenarios, it\u2019s usually impractical for us to obtain the whole real-time graphs due to privacy concerns and technical limitations. In this paper, we introduce the concept of Live Graph Lab for temporal graphs, which enables open, dynamic and real transaction graphs from blockchains. Among them, Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have become one of the most prominent parts of blockchain over the past several years. With more than $40 billion market capitalization, this decentralized ecosystem produces massive, anonymous and real transaction activities, which naturally forms a com- plicated transaction network. However, there is limited understanding about the characteristics of this emerging NFT ecosystem from a temporal graph analysis perspective. To mitigate this gap, we instantiate a live graph with NFT transaction network and investigate its dynamics to provide new observations and insights. Specifically, through downloading and parsing the NFT transaction activities, we obtain a temporal graph with more than 4.5 million nodes and 124 million edges. Then, a series of measurements are presented to understand the properties of the NFT ecosystem. Through comparisons with social, citation, and web networks, our analyses give intriguing findings and point out potential directions for future exploration.

However, the inherent suboptimal nature of node con- nections, resulting from the complex and contingent formation process of graphs, presents significant challenges in modeling them effectively. To tackle this issue, Graph Structure Learning (GSL), a family of data-centric learning approaches, has garnered substantial attention in recent years. The core concept behind GSL is to jointly optimize the graph structure and the corresponding GNN models. Despite the proposal of numerous GSL methods, the progress in this field remains unclear due to inconsistent experimental protocols, including variations in datasets, data processing techniques, and splitting strategies. In this paper, we introduce OpenGSL, the first comprehensive benchmark for GSL, aimed at addressing this gap. OpenGSL enables a fair comparison among state-of-the-art GSL methods by evaluating them across various popular datasets using uniform data processing and splitting strategies. Through extensive experiments, we observe that existing GSL methods do not consistently outperform vanilla GNN counterparts. We also find that there is no significant correlation between the homophily of the learned struc- ture and task performance, challenging the common belief. Moreover, we observe that the learned graph structure demonstrates a strong generalization ability across different GNN models, despite the high computational and space consumption.

        "abstract": "Advancements in deep neural networks have allowed automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems to attain human parity on several publicly available clean speech datasets. However, even state-of-the-art ASR systems experience performance degradation when confronted with adverse conditions, as a well-trained acous- tic model is sensitive to variations in the speech domain, e.g., background noise. Intuitively, humans address this issue by relying on their linguistic knowledge: the meaning of ambiguous spoken terms is usually inferred from contextual cues thereby reducing the dependency on the auditory system. Inspired by this observa- tion, we introduce the first open-source benchmark to utilize external large language models (LLMs) for ASR error correction, where N-best decoding hypotheses pro- vide informative elements for true transcription prediction. This approach is a paradigm shift from the traditional language model rescoring strategy that can only select one candidate hypothesis as the output transcription. The proposed benchmark contains a novel dataset, \u201cHyPoradise\u201d (HP), encompassing more than 334,000 pairs of N-best hypotheses and corresponding accurate transcriptions across prevalent speech domains. Given this dataset, we examine three types of error correction techniques based on LLMs with varying amounts of labeled hypotheses-transcription pairs, which gains a significant word error rate (WER) reduction. Experimental evidence demonstrates the proposed technique achieves a breakthrough by surpassing the upper bound of traditional re-ranking based meth- ods. More surprisingly, LLM with reasonable prompt and its generative capability can even correct those tokens that are missing in N-best list. We make our results publicly accessible for reproducible pipelines with released pre-trained models, thus providing a new evaluation paradigm for ASR error correction with LLMs.",

There is a strong need for systematic and extensible planning benchmarks with sufficient diversity to evaluate whether LLMs have innate planning capabilities. Motivated by this, we propose PlanBench, an extensible benchmark suite based on the kinds of domains used in the automated planning community, especially in the International Planning Competition, to test the capabilities of LLMs in planning or reasoning about actions and change. PlanBench provides sufficient diversity in both the task domains and the specific planning capabilities.

We present ClimSim, the largest-ever dataset designed for hybrid ML-physics re- search. It comprises multi-scale climate simulations, developed by a consortium of climate scientists and ML researchers. It consists of 5.7 billion pairs of multivariate input and output vectors that isolate the influence of locally-nested, high-resolution, high-fidelity physics on a host climate simulator\u2019s macro-scale physical state.\nThe dataset is global in coverage, spans multiple years at high sampling frequency, and is designed such that resulting emulators are compatible with downstream cou- pling into operational climate simulators. We implement a range of deterministic and stochastic regression baselines to highlight the ML challenges and their scoring. The data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/LEAP/ClimSim_high-res 2) and code (https://leap-stc.github.io/ClimSim) are released openly to support the development of hybrid ML-physics and high-fidelity climate simula- tions for the benefit of science and society.",

        "abstract": "Recent accelerations in multi-modal applications have been made possible with the plethora of image and text data available online. However, the scarcity of analogous data in the medical field, specifically in histopathology, has slowed comparable progress. To enable similar representation learning for histopathology, we turn to YouTube, an untapped resource of videos, offering 1, 087 hours of valuable educational histopathology videos from expert clinicians. From YouTube, we curate QUILT: a large-scale vision-language dataset consisting of 802,144 image and text pairs. QUILT was automatically curated using a mixture of models, including large language models, handcrafted algorithms, human knowledge databases, and automatic speech recognition. In comparison, the most comprehensive datasets curated for histopathology amass only around 200K samples. We combine QUILT with datasets from other sources, including Twitter, research papers, and the internet in general, to create an even larger dataset: QUILT-1M, with 1M paired image- text samples, marking it as the largest vision-language histopathology dataset to date. We demonstrate the value of QUILT-1M by fine-tuning a pre-trained CLIP model. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art models on both zero-shot and linear probing tasks for classifying new histopathology images across 13 diverse patch-level datasets of 8 different sub-pathologies and cross-modal retrieval tasks",

There are important open questions about the utility and fairness of such tools. Academic researchers often rely on a few small datasets that are not sufficient to empirically study various real-world aspects of these questions. In this paper, we contribute WCLD, a curated large dataset of 1.5 million criminal cases from circuit courts in the U.S. state of Wisconsin. We used reliable public data from 1970 to 2020 to curate attributes like prior criminal counts and recidivism outcomes. The dataset contains large number of samples from five racial groups, in addition to information like sex and age (at judgment and first offense). Other attributes in this dataset include neighborhood characteristics obtained from census data, detailed types of offense, charge severity, case decisions, sentence lengths, year of filing etc. We also provide pseudo-identifiers for judge, county and zipcode. The dataset will not only enable researchers to more rigorously study algorithmic fairness in the context of criminal justice, but also relate algorithmic challenges with various systemic issues. We also discuss in detail the process of constructing the dataset and provide a datasheet. The WCLD dataset is available at https://clezdata.github.io/wcld/.",

However, selecting the best-performing VLM for some downstream applications is non-trivial, as it is dataset and task-dependent. Meanwhile, the exhaustive evaluation of all available VLMs on a novel application is not only time and computationally demanding but also necessitates the collection of a labeled dataset for evaluation. As the number of open-source VLM variants increases, there is a need for an efficient model selection strategy that does not require access to a curated evaluation dataset. This paper proposes a novel task and benchmark for efficiently evaluating VLMs\u2019 zero-shot performance on downstream applications without access to the downstream task dataset. Specifically, we introduce a new task LOVM: Language- Only Vision Model Selection, where methods are expected to perform both model selection and performance prediction based solely on a text description of the desired downstream application. We then introduced an extensive LOVM benchmark consisting of ground-truth evaluations of 35 pre-trained VLMs and 23 datasets, where methods are expected to rank the pre-trained VLMs and predict their zero-shot performance.",

        "abstract": "Antibodies have become an important class of therapeutic agents to treat human diseases. To accelerate therapeutic antibody discovery, computational methods, especially machine learning, have attracted considerable interest for predicting specific interactions between antibody candidates and target antigens such as viruses and bacteria. However, the publicly available datasets in existing works have notable limitations, such as small sizes and the lack of non-binding samples and exact amino acid sequences. To overcome these limitations, we have developed AVIDa-hIL6, a large-scale dataset for predicting antigen-antibody interactions in the variable domain of heavy chain of heavy chain antibodies (VHHs), produced from an alpaca immunized with the human interleukin-6 (IL-6) protein, as antigens. By leveraging the simple structure of VHHs, which facilitates identification of full- length amino acid sequences by DNA sequencing technology, AVIDa-hIL6 contains 573,891 antigen-VHH pairs with amino acid sequences. All the antigen-VHH pairs have reliable labels for binding or non-binding, as generated by a novel labeling method. Furthermore, via introduction of artificial mutations, AVIDa-hIL6 contains 30 different mutants in addition to wild-type IL-6 protein. This characteristic provides opportunities to develop machine learning models for predicting changes in antibody binding by antigen mutations. We report experimental benchmark results on AVIDa-hIL6 by using machine learning models. The results indicate that the existing models have potential, but further research is needed to generalize them to predict effective antibodies against unknown mutants.

        "abstract": "Labeling neural network submodules with human-legible descriptions is useful for many downstream tasks: such descriptions can surface failures, guide interventions, and perhaps even explain important model behaviors. To date, most mechanistic descriptions of trained networks have involved small models, narrowly delimited phenomena, and large amounts of human labor. Labeling all human-interpretable sub-computations in models of increasing size and complexity will almost certainly require tools that can generate and validate descriptions automatically. Recently, techniques that use learned models in-the-loop for labeling have begun to gain traction, but methods for evaluating their efficacy are limited and ad-hoc. How should we validate and compare open-ended labeling tools? This paper introduces FIND (Function INterpretation and Description), a benchmark suite for evaluating the building blocks of automated interpretability methods. FIND contains functions that resemble components of trained neural networks, and accompanying descrip- tions of the kind we seek to generate. The functions are procedurally constructed across textual and numeric domains, and involve a range of real-world complexities, including noise, composition, approximation, and bias. We evaluate methods that use pretrained language models (LMs) to produce code-based and natural language descriptions of function behavior. Additionally, we introduce a new interactive method in which an Automated Interpretability Agent (AIA) generates function descriptions. We find that an AIA, built with an off-the-shelf LM augmented with black-box access to functions, can sometimes infer function structure\u2014acting as a scientist by forming hypotheses, proposing experiments, and updating descriptions in light of new data. However, FIND also reveals that LM-based descriptions capture global function behavior while missing local details. These results suggest that FIND will be useful for characterizing the performance of more sophisticated interpretability methods before they are applied to real-world models.",

However, the lack of datasets on non-human primate behavior hinders in-depth exploration of primate social interactions, posing challenges to research on our closest living relatives. To address these limitations, we present ChimpACT, a comprehensive dataset for quantifying the longitudinal behavior and social relations of chimpanzees within a social group. Spanning from 2015 to 2018, ChimpACT features videos of a group of over 20 chimpanzees residing at the Leipzig Zoo, Germany, with a particular focus on documenting the developmental trajectory of one young male, Azibo. ChimpACT is both com- prehensive and challenging, consisting of 163 videos with a cumulative 160,500 frames, each richly annotated with detection, identification, pose estimation, and fine-grained spatiotemporal behavior labels. We benchmark representative methods of three tracks on ChimpACT: (i) tracking and identification, (ii) pose estimation, and (iii) spatiotemporal action detection of the chimpanzees. Our experiments reveal that ChimpACT offers ample opportunities for both devising new methods and adapting existing ones to solve fundamental computer vision tasks applied to chimpanzee groups, such as detection, pose estimation, and behavior analy- sis, ultimately deepening our comprehension of communication and sociality in non-human primates",

Although the impact and novelty of innovations expressed in patent data are difficult to measure through traditional means, ML offers a promising set of techniques for evaluating novelty, summarizing contribu- tions, and embedding semantics. In this paper, we introduce the Harvard USPTO Patent Dataset (HUPD), a large-scale, well-structured, and multi-purpose corpus of English-language patent applications filed to the United States Patent and Trade- mark Office (USPTO) between 2004 and 2018. With more than 4.5 million patent documents, HUPD is two to three times larger than comparable corpora. Unlike previously proposed patent datasets in NLP, HUPD contains the inventor-submitted versions of patent applications\u2014not the final versions of granted patents\u2014thereby allowing us to study patentability at the time of filing using NLP methods for the first time. It is also novel in its inclusion of rich structured metadata alongside the text of patent filings: By providing each application\u2019s metadata along with all of its text fields, the dataset enables researchers to perform new sets of NLP tasks that leverage variation in structured covariates. As a case study on the types of research HUPD makes possible, we introduce a new task to the NLP community\u2014namely, binary classification of patent decisions. We additionally show the structured metadata provided in the dataset enables us to conduct explicit studies of concept shifts for this task. Finally, we demonstrate how our dataset can be used for three additional tasks: multi-class classification of patent subject areas, language mod- eling, and summarization. Overall, HUPD is one of the largest multi-purpose NLP datasets containing domain-specific textual data, along with well-structured bibliographic metadata, and aims to advance research extending language and classification models to diverse and dynamic real-world data distributions.",

This direction remains under-explored, resulting in sub- stantial impediments to the progress of factuality evaluators. To mitigate this issue, we introduce a benchmark for Factuality Evaluation of large Language Models, referred to as FELM. In this benchmark, we collect responses generated from LLMs and annotate factuality labels in a fine-grained manner. Contrary to previous studies that primarily concentrate on the factuality of world knowledge (e.g. in- formation from Wikipedia), FELM focuses on factuality across diverse domains, spanning from world knowledge to math and reasoning. Our annotation is based on text segments, which can help pinpoint specific factual errors. The factuality annotations are further supplemented by predefined error types and reference links that either support or contradict the statement. In our experiments, we investigate the performance of several LLM-based factuality evaluators on FELM, including both vanilla LLMs and those augmented with retrieval mechanisms and chain-of- thought processes. Our findings reveal that while retrieval aids factuality evaluation, current LLMs are far from satisfactory to faithfully detect factual errors.1",

However, their potential extends far beyond NLP. This paper pro- vides a software utility to help realize this potential, extending the applicability of GPTs to continuous-time sequences of complex events with internal dependencies, such as medical record datasets. Despite their potential, the adoption of foundation models in these domains has been hampered by the lack of suitable tools for model construction and evaluation. To bridge this gap, we introduce Event Stream GPT (ESGPT), an open-source library designed to streamline the end-to-end process for building GPTs for continuous-time event sequences. ESGPT allows users to (1) build flexible, foundation-model scale input datasets by specifying only a minimal configuration file, (2) leverage a Hugging Face compatible modeling API for GPTs over this modality that incorporates intra-event causal dependency structures and autoregressive generation capabilities, and (3) evaluate models via standardized processes that can assess few and even zero-shot performance of pre-trained models on user-specified fine-tuning tasks.",

        "abstract": "We introduce Dataset Grouper, a library to create large-scale group-structured (e.g., federated) datasets, enabling federated learning simulation at the scale of foundation models. This library facilitates the creation of group-structured ver- sions of existing datasets based on user-specified partitions, and directly leads to a variety of useful heterogeneous datasets that can be plugged into existing software frameworks. Dataset Grouper offers three key advantages. First, it scales to settings where even a single group\u2019s dataset is too large to fit in mem- ory. Second, it provides flexibility, both in choosing the base (non-partitioned) dataset and in defining partitions. Finally, it is framework-agnostic. We empir- ically demonstrate that Dataset Grouper enables large-scale federated language modeling simulations on datasets that are orders of magnitude larger than in pre- vious work, allowing for federated training of language models with hundreds of millions, and even billions, of parameters. Our experimental results show that algorithms like FedAvg operate more as meta-learning methods than as em- pirical risk minimization methods at this scale, suggesting their utility in down- stream personalization and task-specific adaptation.

Representing the largest scale and diversity in the realm of 3D datasets, Objaverse-XL enables significant new possibilities for 3D vision. Our experiments demonstrate the improvements enabled with the scale provided by Objaverse-XL. We show that by training Zero123 on novel view synthesis, utilizing over 100 million multi-view rendered images, we achieve strong zero-shot generalization abilities.

Existing methods typically focus on estimating 3D bounding boxes, neglecting finer geometric details and struggling to handle general, out-of-vocabulary ob- jects. 3D occupancy prediction, which estimates the detailed occupancy states and semantics of a scene, is an emerging task to overcome these limitations. To support 3D occupancy prediction, we develop a label generation pipeline that produces dense, visibility-aware labels for any given scene.

We establish two benchmarks, derived from the Waymo Open Dataset and the nuScenes Dataset, namely Occ3D-Waymo and Occ3D-nuScenes benchmarks. Furthermore, we provide an extensive analysis of the proposed dataset with various baseline models.

        "abstract": "Short-term forecasting of residential and commercial building energy consumption is widely used in power systems and continues to grow in importance. Data-driven short-term load forecasting (STLF), although promising, has suffered from a lack of open, large-scale datasets with high building diversity. This has hindered exploring the pretrain-then-fine-tune paradigm for STLF. To help address this, we present BuildingsBench, which consists of: 1) Buildings-900K, a large-scale dataset of 900K simulated buildings representing the U.S. building stock; and 2) an evaluation platform with over 1,900 real residential and commercial buildings from 7 open datasets. BuildingsBench benchmarks two under-explored tasks: zero-shot STLF, where a pretrained model is evaluated on unseen buildings without fine-tuning, and transfer learning, where a pretrained model is fine-tuned on a target building. The main finding of our benchmark analysis is that synthetically pretrained models generalize surprisingly well to real commercial buildings. An exploration of the effect of increasing dataset size and diversity on zero-shot commercial building performance reveals a power-law with diminishing returns. We also show that fine- tuning pretrained models on real commercial and residential buildings improves performance for a majority of target buildings. We hope that BuildingsBench encourages and facilitates future research on generalizable STLF. All datasets and code can be accessed from https://github.com/NREL/BuildingsBench.",

        "abstract": "Biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, impacting ecosystem services necessary to ensure food, water, and human health and well-being. Understanding the distribution of species and their habitats is crucial for conservation policy planning. However, traditional methods in ecology for species distribution models (SDMs) generally focus either on narrow sets of species or narrow geographical areas and there remain significant knowledge gaps about the distribution of species. A major reason for this is the limited availability of data traditionally used, due to the prohibitive amount of effort and expertise required for traditional field monitoring. The wide availability of remote sensing data and the growing adoption of citizen science tools to collect species observations data at low cost offer an opportunity for improving biodiversity monitoring and enabling the modelling of complex ecosystems. We introduce a novel task for mapping bird species to their habitats by predicting species encounter rates from satellite images, and present SatBird1, a satellite dataset of locations in the USA with labels derived from presence-absence observation data from the citizen science database eBird, considering summer (breeding) and winter seasons. We also provide a dataset in Kenya representing low-data regimes. We additionally provide environmental data and species range maps for each location. We benchmark a set of baselines on our dataset, including SOTA models for remote sensing tasks. SatBird opens up possibilities for scalably modelling properties of ecosystems worldwide.",

        "abstract": "Machine learning provides a valuable tool for analyzing high-dimensional func- tional neuroimaging data, and is proving effective in predicting various neurological conditions, psychiatric disorders, and cognitive patterns. In functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) research, interactions between brain regions are com- monly modeled using graph-based representations. The potency of graph machine learning methods has been established across myriad domains, marking a trans- formative step in data interpretation and predictive modeling. Yet, despite their promise, the transposition of these techniques to the neuroimaging domain has been challenging due to the expansive number of potential preprocessing pipelines and the large parameter search space for graph-based dataset construction. In this paper, we introduce NeuroGraph1, a collection of graph-based neuroimaging datasets, and demonstrated its utility for predicting multiple categories of behavioral and cogni- tive traits. We delve deeply into the dataset generation search space by crafting 35 datasets that encompass static and dynamic brain connectivity, running in excess of 15 baseline methods for benchmarking. Additionally, we provide generic frame- works for learning on both static and dynamic graphs. Our extensive experiments lead to several key observations. Notably, using correlation vectors as node features, incorporating larger number of regions of interest, and employing sparser graphs lead to improved performance. To foster further advancements in graph-based data driven neuroimaging analysis, we offer a comprehensive open-source Python package that includes the benchmark datasets, baseline implementations, model training, and standard evaluation.",

Sketch understanding poses fundamental challenges for general- purpose vision algorithms because it requires robustness to the sparsity of sketches relative to natural visual inputs and because it demands tolerance for semantic ambiguity, as sketches can reliably evoke multiple meanings. While current vision algorithms have achieved high performance on a variety of visual tasks, it remains unclear to what extent they understand sketches in a human-like way. Here we introduce SEVA, a new benchmark dataset containing approximately 90K human- generated sketches of 128 object concepts produced under different time constraints, and thus systematically varying in sparsity. We evaluated a suite of state-of-the-art vision algorithms on their ability to correctly identify the target concept depicted in these sketches and to generate responses that are strongly aligned with human response patterns on the same sketch recognition task. We found that vision algorithms that better predicted human sketch recognition performance also better approximated human uncertainty about sketch meaning, but there remains a sizable gap between model and human response patterns. To explore the potential of models that emulate human visual abstraction in generative tasks, we conducted further evaluations of a recently developed sketch generation algorithm [91] capable of generating sketches that vary in sparsity. We hope that public release of this dataset and evaluation protocol will catalyze progress towards algorithms with enhanced capacities for human-like visual abstraction.",

Compared to existing benchmarks that focus on computational tasks (e.g. classification, detection or tracking), the Perception Test focuses on skills (Memory, Abstraction, Physics, Semantics) and types of reasoning (descriptive, explanatory, predictive, counterfactual) across video, audio, and text modalities, to provide a comprehensive and efficient evaluation tool. The benchmark probes pre-trained models for their transfer capabilities, in a zero-shot / few-shot or limited finetuning regime. For these purposes, the Perception Test intro- duces 11.6k real-world videos, 23s average length, designed to show perceptually interesting situations, filmed by around 100 participants worldwide. The videos are densely annotated with six types of labels (multiple-choice and grounded video question-answers, object and point tracks, temporal action and sound segments), enabling both language and non-language evaluations. The fine-tuning and valida- tion splits of the benchmark are publicly available (CC-BY license), in addition to a challenge server with a held-out test split. Human baseline results compared to state-of-the-art video QA models show a substantial gap in performance (91.4% vs 46.2%), suggesting that there is significant room for improvement in multimodal video understanding.

This risks simplifying and even obscuring the inherent subjectivity present in many tasks. Preserving such variance in content and diversity in datasets is often expensive and laborious. This is especially troubling when building safety datasets for conversational AI systems, as safety is both socially and culturally situated. To demonstrate this crucial aspect of conversational AI safety, and to facilitate in-depth model performance analyses, we introduce the DICES (Diversity In Conversational AI Evaluation for Safety) dataset that contains fine-grained demographic information about raters, high replication of ratings per item to ensure statistical power for analyses, and encodes rater votes as distributions across different demographics to allow for in- depth explorations of different aggregation strategies. In short, the DICES dataset enables the observation and measurement of variance, ambiguity, and diversity in the context of conversational AI safety. We also illustrate how the dataset offers a basis for establishing metrics to show how raters\u2019 ratings can intersects with demographic categories such as racial/ethnic groups, age groups, and genders. The goal of DICES is to be used as a shared resource and benchmark that respects diverse perspectives during safety evaluation of conversational AI systems.",

We identify three key chemistry- related capabilities including understanding, reasoning and explaining to explore in LLMs and establish a benchmark containing eight chemistry tasks. Our anal- ysis draws on widely recognized datasets facilitating a broad exploration of the capacities of LLMs within the context of practical chemistry.

However, selecting the right GL model becomes increasingly difficult and time consuming as more and more GL models are developed. Accordingly, it is of great significance and practical value to equip users of GL with the ability to perform a near-instantaneous selection of an effective GL model without manual interven- tion. Despite the recent attempts to tackle this important problem, there has been no comprehensive benchmark environment to evaluate the performance of GL model selection methods. To bridge this gap, we present GLEMOS in this work, a comprehensive benchmark for instantaneous GL model selection that makes the following contributions.

The dataset comprises 635 smartphone-based fundus videos collected from four different clinics, involving 415 patients from 50 to 75 years old. It delivers comprehensive and precise annotations of retinal structures in both spatial and temporal dimensions, aiming to advance the landscape of vasculature segmentation. Specifically, the dataset provides three levels of spatial annotations: binary vessel masks for overall retinal structure delineation, general vein-artery masks for distinguishing the vein and artery, and fine-grained vein-artery masks for further characterizing the granularities of each artery and vein. In addition, the dataset offers temporal annotations that capture the vessel pulsation characteristics, assisting in detecting ocular diseases that require fine-grained recognition of hemodynamic fluctuation. In application, our dataset exhibits a significant domain shift with respect to data captured by bench-top devices, thus posing great challenges to existing methods. Thanks to rich annotations and data scales, our dataset potentially paves the path for more advanced retinal analysis and accurate disease diagnosis. In the experiments, we provide evaluation metrics and benchmark results on our dataset, reflecting both the potential and challenges it offers for vessel segmentation tasks.

This capability is vital for Artificial Intelligence (AI) and should be embedded in comprehensive AI Agents, enabling them to harness expert models for complex task-solving towards Artificial General Intelligence (AGI). Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising learning and reasoning abilities, and can effectively use external models, tools, plugins, or APIs to tackle complex problems. In this work, we introduce OpenAGI, an open-source AGI research and development platform designed for solving multi-step, real-world tasks. Specifically, OpenAGI uses a dual strategy, integrating standard benchmark tasks for benchmarking and evaluation, and open-ended tasks including more expandable models, tools, plugins, or APIs for creative problem-solving. Tasks are presented as natural language queries to the LLM, which then selects and executes appropriate models. We also propose a Reinforcement Learning from Task Feedback (RLTF) mechanism that uses task results to improve the LLM\u2019s task-solving ability, which creates a self-improving AI feedback loop. While we acknowledge that AGI is a broad and multifaceted research challenge with no singularly defined solution path, the integration of LLMs with domain-specific expert models, inspired by mirroring the blend of general and specialized intelligence in humans, offers a promising approach towards AGI. We are open-sourcing the OpenAGI project\u2019s code, dataset, benchmarks, evaluation methods, and the UI demo to foster community involvement in AGI advancement: https://github.com/agiresearch/OpenAGI.",

        "abstract": "Millimetre-wave (mmWave) radar has emerged as an attractive and cost-effective alternative for human activity sensing compared to traditional camera-based sys- tems. mmWave radars are also non-intrusive, providing better protection for user privacy. However, as a Radio Frequency (RF) based technology, mmWave radars rely on capturing reflected signals from objects, making them more prone to noise compared to cameras. This raises an intriguing question for the deep learning community: Can we develop more effective point set-based deep learning methods for such attractive sensors?\nTo answer this question, our work, termed MiliPoint2, delves into this idea by providing a large-scale, open dataset for the community to explore how mmWave radars can be utilised for human activity recognition. Moreover, MiliPoint stands out as it is larger in size than existing datasets, has more diverse human actions represented, and encompasses all three key tasks in human activity recognition. We have also established a range of point-based deep neural networks such as DGCNN, PointNet++ and PointTransformer, on MiliPoint, which can serve to set the ground baseline for further development.",

As a result, our dataset includes diverse ECG interpretation questions, including those that require a comparative analysis of two different ECGs.

        "abstract": "The quest for human imitative AI has been an enduring topic in AI research since its inception. The technical evolution and emerging capabilities of the latest cohort of large language models (LLMs) have reinvigorated the subject beyond academia to the cultural zeitgeist. While recent NLP evaluation benchmark tasks test some as- pects of human-imitative behavior (e.g., BIG-bench\u2019s \u2018human-like behavior\u2019 tasks), few, if not none, examine creative problem solving abilities. Creative problem solv- ing in humans is a well-studied topic in cognitive neuroscience with standardized tests that predominantly use the ability to associate (heterogeneous) connections among clue words as a metric for creativity. Exposure to misleading stimuli \u2014 distractors dubbed red herrings \u2014 impede human performance in such tasks via the fixation effect and Einstellung paradigm. In cognitive neuroscience studies, such fixations are experimentally induced by pre-exposing participants to orthographi- cally similar incorrect words to subsequent word-fragments or clues. The popular British quiz show Only Connect\u2019s Connecting Wall segment essentially mimics Mednick\u2019s Remote Associates Test (RAT) formulation with built-in, deliberate red herrings, which makes it an ideal proxy task to explore and study the fixation effect and Einstellung paradigm from cognitive neuroscience in LLMs. In this paper, we present the novel Only Connect Wall (OCW) dataset and report results from our evaluation of selected pre-trained language models and LLMs on creative problem solving tasks like grouping clue words by heterogeneous connections and identifying correct open knowledge domain connections in respective groups. We synthetically generate two additional datasets: OCW-Randomized, OCW-WordNet to further analyze our red-herrings hypothesis in language models.

Existing evaluation datasets for this task are limited, primarily due to the high cost and effort required to annotate resources that effectively represent complex queries. To address this, we propose a novel task, Scientific DOcument Retrieval using Multi-level Aspect-based quEries (DORIS- MAE), which is designed to handle the complex nature of user queries in scientific research. We developed a benchmark dataset within the field of computer science, consisting of 100 human-authored complex query cases. For each complex query, we assembled a collection of 100 relevant documents and produced annotated relevance scores for ranking them. Recognizing the significant labor of expert annotation, we also introduce Anno-GPT, a scalable framework for validating the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) on expert-level dataset annotation tasks. LLM annotation of the DORIS-MAE dataset resulted in a 500x reduction in cost, without compromising quality. Furthermore, due to the multi-tiered structure of these complex queries, the DORIS-MAE dataset can be extended to over 4,000 sub-query test cases without requiring additional annotation. We evaluated 17 recent retrieval methods on DORIS-MAE, observing notable performance drops compared to traditional datasets. This highlights the need for better approaches to handle complex, multifaceted queries in scientific research.

While the impact of model scaling has been extensively studied, we are only beginning to scratch the surface of data scaling and its consequences. This is especially of critical importance in the context of vision- language datasets such as LAION. These datasets are continually growing in size and are built based on large-scale internet dumps such as the Common Crawl, which is known to have numerous drawbacks ranging from quality, legality, and content. The datasets then serve as the backbone for large generative models, contributing to the operationalization and perpetuation of harmful societal and historical biases and stereotypes. In this paper, we investigate the effect of scaling datasets on hateful content through a comparative audit of two datasets: LAION-400M and LAION-2B. Our results show that hate content increased by nearly 12% with dataset scale, measured both qualitatively and quantitatively using a metric that we term as Hate Content Rate (HCR). We also found that filtering dataset contents based on Not Safe For Work (NSFW) values calculated based on images alone does not exclude all the harmful content in alt-text. Instead, we found that trace amounts of hateful, targeted, and aggressive text remain even when carrying out conservative filtering. We end with a reflection and a discussion of the significance of our results for dataset curation and usage in the AI community.

For instance, an in-depth study of White Blood Cells (WBCs), a crucial component of our blood, is essential for diagnosing blood-related diseases such as leukemia and anemia. While multiple datasets containing WBC images have been proposed, they mostly focus on cell categorization, often lacking the necessary morphological details to explain such categorizations, despite the importance of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) in medical domains. This paper seeks to address this limitation by introducing comprehensive annotations for WBC images. Through collaboration with pathologists, a thorough literature review, and manual inspection of microscopic images, we have identified 11 morphological attributes associated with the cell and its components (nucleus, cytoplasm, and granules). We then annotated ten thousand WBC images with these attributes, resulting in 113k labels (11 attributes x 10.3k images). Annotating at this level of detail and scale is unprecedented, offering unique value to AI in pathology. Moreover, we conduct experiments to predict these attributes from cell images, and also demonstrate specific applications that can benefit from our detailed annotations. Overall, our dataset paves the way for interpreting WBC recognition models, further advancing XAI in the fields of pathology and hematology.",

        "abstract": "Tabular data is one of the most commonly used types of data in machine learning. Despite recent advances in neural nets (NNs) for tabular data, there is still an active discussion on whether or not NNs generally outperform gradient-boosted decision trees (GBDTs) on tabular data, with several recent works arguing either that GBDTs consistently outperform NNs on tabular data, or vice versa. In this work, we take a step back and question the importance of this debate. To this end, we conduct the largest tabular data analysis to date, comparing 19 algorithms across 176 datasets, and we find that the \u2018NN vs. GBDT\u2019 debate is overemphasized: for a surprisingly high number of datasets, either the performance difference between GBDTs and NNs is negligible, or light hyperparameter tuning on a GBDT is more important than choosing between NNs and GBDTs. A remarkable exception is the recently-proposed prior-data fitted network, TabPFN: although it is effectively limited to training sets of size 3000, we find that it outperforms all other algorithms on average, even when randomly sampling 3000 training datapoints. Next, we analyze dozens of metafeatures to determine what properties of a dataset make NNs or GBDTs better-suited to perform well. For example, we find that GBDTs are much better than NNs at handling skewed or heavy-tailed feature distributions and other forms of dataset irregularities. Our insights act as a guide for practitioners to determine which techniques may work best on their dataset. Finally, with the goal of accelerating tabular data research, we release the TabZilla Benchmark Suite: a collection of the 36 \u2018hardest\u2019 of the datasets we study.

VidChapters- 7M is automatically created from videos online in a scalable manner by scraping user-annotated chapters and hence without any additional manual annotation. We introduce the following three tasks based on this data. First, the video chapter gen- eration task consists of temporally segmenting the video and generating a chapter title for each segment. To further dissect the problem, we also define two variants of this task: video chapter generation given ground-truth boundaries, which requires generating a chapter title given an annotated video segment, and video chapter grounding, which requires temporally localizing a chapter given its annotated title. We benchmark both simple baselines and state-of-the-art video-language models for these three tasks.

We hypothesize that one way for image classifiers to reach high accuracy is to zoom to the most discriminative region in the image and then extract features from there to predict image labels, discarding the rest of the image. Studying six popular networks ranging from AlexNet to CLIP, we find that proper framing of the input image can lead to the correct classification of 98.91% of ImageNet images. Furthermore, we uncover positional biases in various datasets, especially a strong center bias in two popular datasets: ImageNet-A and ObjectNet. Finally, leveraging our insights into the potential of zooming, we propose a test-time augmentation (TTA) technique that improves classification accuracy by forcing models to explicitly perform zoom-in operations before making predictions. Our method is more interpretable, accurate, and faster than MEMO, a state-of-the-art (SOTA) TTA method.

In this study, we assess the robustness of 11 widely-used adaptation methods across 4 vision-language datasets under multimodal corrup- tions. Concretely, we introduce 7 benchmark datasets, including 96 visual and 87 textual corruptions, to investigate the robustness of different adaptation methods, the impact of available adaptation examples, and the influence of trainable parame- ter size during adaptation. Our analysis reveals that: 1) Adaptation methods are more sensitive to text corruptions than visual corruptions. 2) Full fine-tuning does not consistently provide the highest robustness; instead, adapters can achieve better robustness with comparable clean performance. 3) Contrary to expectations, our findings indicate that increasing the number of adaptation data and parameters does not guarantee enhanced robustness; instead, it results in even lower robustness. We hope this study could benefit future research in developing robust multimodal adaptation methods.

Due to the importance and implications of their results regarding generalization ability of deep models, we take a second look at their findings. We highlight a major problem with their work which is applying object recognizers to the scenes containing multiple objects rather than isolated objects. The latter results in around 20-30% performance gain using our code. Compared with the results reported in the ObjectNet paper, we observe that around 10-15% of the performance loss can be recovered, without any test time data augmentation. In accordance with Barbu et al.\u2019s conclusions, however, we also conclude that deep models suffer drastically on this dataset.

Derived from Ego4D, EgoSchema consists of over 5000 human curated multiple choice question answer pairs, spanning over 250 hours of real video data, covering a very broad range of natural human activity and behavior. For each question, EgoSchema requires the correct answer to be selected between five given options based on a three-minute-long video clip. While some prior works have proposed video datasets with long clip lengths, we posit that merely the length of the video clip does not truly capture the temporal difficulty of the video task that is being considered. To remedy this, we introduce temporal certificate sets, a general notion for capturing the intrinsic temporal understanding length associated with a broad range of video understanding tasks & datasets. Based on this metric, we find EgoSchema to have intrinsic temporal lengths over 5.7\u00d7 longer than the second closest dataset and 10\u00d7 to 100\u00d7 longer than any other video understanding dataset. Further, our evaluation of several current state-of-the-art video and language models shows them to be severely lacking in long-term video understanding capabilities. Even models with several billions of parameters achieve QA accuracy less than 33% (random is 20%) on the EgoSchema multi-choice question answering task, while humans achieve about 76% accuracy.

        "abstract": "Semantic segmentation datasets often exhibit two types of imbalance: class imbal- ance, where some classes appear more frequently than others and size imbalance, where some objects occupy more pixels than others. This causes traditional evalua- tion metrics to be biased towards majority classes (e.g. overall pixel-wise accuracy) and large objects (e.g. mean pixel-wise accuracy and per-dataset mean intersection over union). To address these shortcomings, we propose the use of fine-grained mIoUs along with corresponding worst-case metrics, thereby offering a more holis- tic evaluation of segmentation techniques. These fine-grained metrics offer less bias towards large objects, richer statistical information, and valuable insights into model and dataset auditing. Furthermore, we undertake an extensive benchmark study, where we train and evaluate 15 modern neural networks with the proposed metrics on 12 diverse natural and aerial segmentation datasets. Our benchmark study highlights the necessity of not basing evaluations on a single metric and confirms that fine-grained mIoUs reduce the bias towards large objects. Moreover, we identify the crucial role played by architecture designs and loss functions, which lead to best practices in optimizing fine-grained metrics.

It is imperative that our evaluation resources are en- hanced and calibrated by including people and experiences from different cultures and societies worldwide, in order to prevent gross underestimations or skews in measurements of harm. In this work, we demonstrate a socio-culturally aware expansion of evaluation resources in the Indian societal context, specifically for the harm of stereotyping. We devise a community engaged effort to build a resource which contains stereotypes for axes of disparity that are uniquely present in India. The resultant resource increases the number of stereotypes known for and in the Indian context by over 1000 stereotypes across many unique identities.

Among these, stands out the Neural radiance fields (NeRF) [26], which trains a deep network to map 5D input coordinates (representing spatial location and viewing direction) into a volume density and view-dependent emitted radiance. However, despite achiev- ing an unprecedented level of photorealism on the gener- ated images, NeRF is only applicable to static scenes, where the same spatial location can be queried from different im- ages. In this paper we introduce D-NeRF, a method that extends neural radiance fields to a dynamic domain, allow- ing to reconstruct and render novel images of objects under rigid and non-rigid motions from a single camera moving around the scene. For this purpose we consider time as an additional input to the system, and split the learning process in two main stages: one that encodes the scene into a canon- ical space and another that maps this canonical represen- tation into the deformed scene at a particular time. Both\nmappings are simultaneously learned using fully-connected networks. Once the networks are trained, D-NeRF can ren- der novel images, controlling both the camera view and the time variable, and thus, the object movement.

        "abstract": "Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) are able to reconstruct scenes with unprece- dented fidelity, and various recent works have extended NeRF to handle dynamic scenes. A common approach to reconstruct such non-rigid scenes is through the use of a learned deformation field mapping from coordinates in each input image into a canonical template coordinate space. However, these deformation-based approaches struggle to model changes in topology, as topological changes require a discontinuity in the deformation field, but these deformation fields are necessarily continuous. We address this limita- tion by lifting NeRFs into a higher dimensional space, and by representing the 5D radiance field corresponding to each individual input image as a slice through this \u201chyper-space\u201d. Our method is inspired by level set methods, which model the evolution of surfaces as slices through a higher dimensional surface. We evaluate our method on two tasks: (i) interpolating smoothly be- tween \u201cmoments\u201d, i.e., configurations of the scene, seen in the input images while maintaining visual plausibility, and (ii) novel-view synthesis at fixed moments. We show that our method, which we dub HyperNeRF, outperforms existing methods on both tasks.

This development allows us to create continuous benchmark distributions with the known EOT and SB solutions on high-dimensional spaces such as spaces of images.

Machine learning has achieved remarkable progress in modeling molecular structures, especially biomolecules for drug discovery. However, the development of machine learning approaches for modeling materials structures lag behind, which is partly due to the lack of an integrated platform that enables access to diverse tasks for materials discovery. To bridge this gap, M2Hub will enable easy access to materials discovery tasks, datasets, machine learning methods, evaluations, and benchmark results that cover the entire workflow. Specifically, the first release of M2Hub focuses on three key stages in materials discovery: virtual screening, inverse design, and molecular simulation, including 9 datasets that covers 6 types of materials with 56 tasks across 8 types of material properties. We further provide 2 synthetic datasets for the purpose of generative tasks on materials. In addition to random data splits, we also provide 3 additional data partitions to reflect the real-world materials discovery scenarios. State-of-the-art machine learning meth- ods (including those are suitable for materials structures but never compared in the literature) are benchmarked on representative tasks. Our codes and library are publicly available at https://github.com/yuanqidu/M2Hub.",

        "abstract": "We present a benchmark test suite and an automated machine learning procedure for evaluating supervised machine learning (ML) models for predicting properties of inorganic bulk materials. The test suite, Matbench, is a set of 13 ML tasks that range in size from 312 to 132k samples and contain data from 10 density functional theory-derived and experimental sources. Tasks include predicting optical, thermal, electronic, thermodynamic, tensile, and elastic properties given a materials composition and/or crystal structure. The reference algorithm, Automatminer, is a highly-extensible, fully-automated ML pipeline for predicting materials properties from materials primitives (such as composition and crystal structure) without user intervention or hyperparameter tuning. We test Automatminer on the Matbench test suite and compare its predictive power with state-of-the-art crystal graph neural networks and a traditional descriptor-based Random Forest model. We find Automatminer achieves the best performance on 8 of 13 tasks in the benchmark.\nWe also show our test suite is capable of exposing predictive advantages of each algorithm \u2013 namely, that crystal graph methods appear to outperform traditional machine learning methods given ~104 or greater data points. The pre-processed, ready-to-use Matbench tasks and the Automatminer source code are open source and available online (http://hackingmaterials.lbl.gov/automatminer/). We encourage evaluating new materials ML algorithms on the Matbench benchmark and comparing them against the latest version of Automatminer.",

        "abstract": "System specific neural force fields (NFFs) have gained popularity in computational chemistry. One of the most popular datasets as a bencharmk to develop NFFs models is the MD17 dataset and its subsequent extension. These datasets comprise geometries from the equilibrium region of the ground electronic state potential energy surface, sampled from direct adiabatic dynamics. However, many chemical reactions involve significant molecular geometrical deformations, for example, bond breaking. Therefore, MD17 is inadequate to represent a chemical reaction. To address this limitation in MD17, we introduce a new dataset, called Extended Excited-state Molecular Dynamics (xxMD) dataset. The xxMD dataset involves geometries sampled from direct non-adiabatic dynamics, and the energies are computed at both multireference wavefunction theory and density functional theory. We show that the xxMD dataset involves diverse geometries which represent chemical reactions. Assessment of NFF models on xxMD dataset reveals significantly higher predictive errors than those reported for MD17 and its variants. This work underscores the challenges faced in crafting a generalizable NFF model with extrapolation capability.",

        "abstract": "The similarity among samples and the discrepancy among clusters are two crucial aspects of image clustering. However, current deep clustering methods suffer from inaccurate estimation of either feature similarity or semantic discrepancy. In this paper, we present a Semantic Pseudo-labeling-based Image ClustEring (SPICE) framework, which divides the clustering network into a feature model for measuring the instance-level similarity and a clustering head for identifying the cluster-level discrepancy. We design two semantics-aware pseudo-labeling al- gorithms, prototype pseudo-labeling and reliable pseudo-labeling, which enable accurate and reliable self-supervision over cluster- ing. Without using any ground-truth label, we optimize the clus- tering network in three stages: 1) train the feature model through contrastive learning to measure the instance similarity; 2) train the clustering head with the prototype pseudo-labeling algorithm to identify cluster semantics; and 3) jointly train the feature model and clustering head with the reliable pseudo-labeling algorithm to improve the clustering performance. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that SPICE achieves significant improvements (\u223c10%) over existing methods and establishes the new state-of-the-art clustering results on six image benchmark datasets in terms of three popular metrics. Importantly, SPICE significantly reduces the gap between unsupervised and fully- supervised classification; e.g. there is only 2% (91.8% vs 93.8%) accuracy difference on CIFAR-10.

        "abstract": "Catalyst discovery and optimization is key to solving many societal and energy challenges including solar fuels synthesis, long-term energy storage, and renewable fertilizer production. Despite considerable effort by the catalysis community to apply machine learning models to the computational catalyst discovery process, it remains an open challenge to build mod- els that can generalize across both elemental compositions of surfaces and adsorbate iden- tity/configurations, perhaps because datasets have been smaller in catalysis than related fields. To address this we developed the OC20 dataset, consisting of 1,281,040 Density Functional Theory (DFT) relaxations (\u223c264,890,000 single point evaluations) across a wide swath of materials, surfaces, and adsorbates (nitrogen, carbon, and oxygen chemistries). We supple- mented this dataset with randomly perturbed structures, short timescale molecular dynamics, and electronic structure analyses. The dataset comprises three central tasks indicative of day- to-day catalyst modeling and comes with pre-defined train/validation/test splits to facilitate direct comparisons with future model development efforts. We applied three state-of-the-art graph neural network models (CGCNN, SchNet, DimeNet++) to each of these tasks as base- line demonstrations for the community to build on. In almost every task, no upper limit on model size was identified, suggesting that even larger models are likely to improve on initial results. The dataset and baseline models are both provided as open resources, as well as a public leader board to encourage community contributions to solve these important tasks.",

Thus, we investigate training data generation with diversely attributed prompts (e.g., specifying attributes like length and style), which have the potential to yield diverse and attributed generated data. Our investigation focuses on datasets with high cardinality and diverse domains, wherein we demonstrate that attributed prompts outperform simple class-conditional prompts in terms of the resulting model\u2019s performance. Additionally, we present a comprehensive empirical study on data generation encompassing vital aspects like bias, diversity, and efficiency, and highlight three key observations: firstly, synthetic datasets generated by simple prompts exhibit significant biases, such as regional bias; secondly, attribute diversity plays a pivotal role in enhancing model performance; lastly, attributed prompts achieve the performance of simple class-conditional prompts while utilizing only 5% of the querying cost of ChatGPT associated with the latter.

Erroneous labels on the train set hurt ML models\u2019 ability to generalize, and they impact evaluation and model selection using the test set. Consequently, learning in the presence of labeling errors is an active area of research, yet this field lacks a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate these methods. Most of these methods are evaluated on a few computer vision datasets with significant variance in the experimental protocols. With such a large pool of methods and inconsistent evaluation, it is also unclear how ML practitioners can choose the right models to assess label quality in their data. To this end, we propose a benchmarking environment AQuA to rigorously evaluate methods that enable machine learning in the presence of label noise. We also introduce a design space to delineate concrete design choices of label error detection models. We hope that our proposed design space and benchmark enable practitioners to choose the right tools to improve their label quality and that our benchmark enables objective and rigorous evaluation of machine learning tools facing mislabeled data.",

        "abstract": "Pre-training on massive video datasets has become essential to achieve high action recognition performance on smaller downstream datasets. However, most large- scale video datasets contain images of people and hence are accompanied with issues related to privacy, ethics, and data protection, often preventing them from being publicly shared for reproducible research. Existing work has attempted to alleviate these problems by blurring faces, downsampling videos, or training on synthetic data. On the other hand, analysis on the transferability of privacy- preserving pre-trained models to downstream tasks has been limited. In this work, we study this problem by first asking the question: can we pre-train models for human action recognition with data that does not include real humans? To this end, we present, for the first time, a benchmark that leverages real-world videos with humans removed and synthetic data containing virtual humans to pre-train a model. We then evaluate the transferability of the representation learned on this data to a diverse set of downstream action recognition benchmarks. Furthermore, we propose a novel pre-training strategy, called Privacy-Preserving MAE-Align, to effectively combine synthetic data and human-removed real data. Our approach outperforms previous baselines by up to 5% and closes the performance gap between human and no-human action recognition representations on downstream tasks, for both linear probing and fine-tuning.

While significant progress\nhas been made in object-level Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation (OVSS),\ni.e., segmenting objects with arbitrary text, the corresponding part-level research poses additional challenges. Firstly, part segmentation inherently involves intricate boundaries, while limited annotated data compounds the challenge. Secondly, part segmentation introduces an open granularity challenge due to the diverse and often ambiguous definitions of parts in the open world. Furthermore, the large-scale vision and language models, which play a key role in the open vocabulary setting, struggle to recognize parts as effectively as objects. To comprehensively investigate and tackle these challenges, we propose an Open-Vocabulary Part Segmentation (OV-PARTS) benchmark. OV-PARTS includes refined versions of two publicly available datasets: Pascal-Part-116 and ADE20K-Part-234. And it covers three specific tasks: Generalized Zero-Shot Part Segmentation, Cross-Dataset Part Segmentation, and Few-Shot Part Segmentation, providing insights into analogical reasoning, open granularity and few-shot adapting abilities of models. Moreover, we analyze and adapt two prevailing paradigms of existing object-level OVSS methods for OV-PARTS.

MAGICBRUSH comprises over 10K manually annotated triplets (source image, instruction, target image), which supports training large-scale text- guided image editing models. We fine-tune InstructPix2Pix on MAGICBRUSH and show that the new model can produce much better images according to human evaluation. We further conduct extensive experiments to evaluate current image editing baselines from multiple dimensions including quantitative, qualitative, and human evaluations. The results reveal the challenging nature of our dataset and the gap between current baselines and real-world editing needs.",

The success of foundation models creates new challenges for healthcare ML by requiring access to shared pretrained models to validate performance benefits. We help address these challenges through three contributions. First, we publish a new dataset, EHRSHOT, which contains de- identified structured data from the electronic health records (EHRs) of 6,739 patients from Stanford Medicine. Unlike MIMIC-III/IV and other popular EHR datasets, EHRSHOT is longitudinal and not restricted to ICU/ED patients. Second, we publish the weights of CLMBR-T-base, a 141M parameter clinical foundation model pretrained on the structured EHR data of 2.57M patients. We are one of the first to fully release such a model for coded EHR data; in contrast, most prior models released for clinical data (e.g. GatorTron, ClinicalBERT) only work with unstructured text and cannot process the rich, structured data within an EHR. We provide an end-to-end pipeline for the community to validate and build upon its performance. Third, we define 15 few-shot clinical prediction tasks, enabling evaluation of foundation models on benefits such as sample efficiency and task adaptation. Our model and dataset are available via a research data use agreement from our website. Code to reproduce our results is available here.",

Unlike most vision tasks that have per-sample ground- truth, image synthesis tasks target generating unseen data and hence are usually evaluated through a distributional distance between one set of real samples and another set of generated samples. This study presents an empirical investigation into the evaluation of synthesis performance, with generative adversarial networks (GANs) as a representative of generative models. In particular, we make in- depth analyses of various factors, including how to represent a data point in the representation space, how to calculate a fair distance using selected samples, and how many instances to use from each set. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple datasets and settings reveal several important findings. Firstly, a group of models that include both CNN-based and ViT-based architectures serve as reliable and robust feature extractors for measurement evaluation. Secondly, Centered Kernel Alignment (CKA) provides a better comparison across various extractors and hierarchical layers in one model. Finally, CKA is more sample- efficient and enjoys better agreement with human judgment in characterizing the similarity between two internal data correlations. These findings contribute to the development of a new measurement system, which enables a consistent and reliable re-evaluation of current state-of-the-art generative models.",

However, most existing math reasoning datasets may be not able to fully evaluate and analyze the ability of LLMs in manipulating tools and performing reasoning, as they may only require very few invocations of tools or miss annotations for evaluating intermediate reasoning steps. To address the issue, we construct CARP, a new Chinese dataset consisting of 4,886 computation-intensive algebra problems with formulated annotations on intermediate steps. In CARP, we test four LLMs with CoT prompting, and find that they are all prone to make mistakes at the early steps of the solution, leading to wrong answers. Based on this finding, we propose a new approach that can deliberate the reasoning steps with tool interfaces, namely DELI. In DELI, we first initialize a step-by-step solution based on retrieved exemplars, then iterate two deliberation procedures that check and refine the intermediate steps of the generated solution, from the perspectives of tool manipulation and natural language reasoning, until obtaining converged solutions or reaching the maximum turn. Experimental results on CARP and six other datasets show that the proposed DELI mostly outperforms competitive baselines, and can further boost the performance of existing CoT methods.

However, two significant challenges hinder its research and application. First, existing datasets lack comprehensive visual information from various pose angles. They usually have an unrealistic assumption that the anomaly-free training dataset is pose-aligned, and the testing samples have the same pose as the training data. However, in practice, anomaly may exist in any regions on a object, the training and query samples may have different poses, calling for the study on pose-agnostic anomaly detection. Second, the absence of a consensus on experimental protocols for pose-agnostic anomaly de- tection leads to unfair comparisons of different methods, hindering the research on pose-agnostic anomaly detection. To address these issues, we develop Multi-pose Anomaly Detection (MAD) dataset and Pose-agnostic Anomaly Detection (PAD) benchmark, which takes the first step to address the pose-agnostic anomaly detec- tion problem.

However, high-quality benchmarks for distribution shift in tabular machine learning tasks are still lacking despite the widespread real-world use of tabular data and differences in the models used for tabular data in comparison to text and images. As a consequence, the robustness of tabular models to distribution shift is poorly understood. To address this issue, we introduce TABLESHIFT, a distribution shift benchmark for tabular data. TABLESHIFT contains 15 binary classification tasks in total, each with an associated shift, and includes a diverse set of data sources, prediction targets, and distribution shifts. The benchmark covers domains including finance, education, public policy, healthcare, and civic participation, and is accessible using only a few lines of Python code via the TABLESHIFT API. We conduct a large-scale study comparing several state-of-the-art tabular data models alongside robust learning and domain generalization methods on the benchmark tasks. Our study demonstrates (1) a linear trend between in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) accuracy; (2) domain robustness methods can reduce shift gaps but at the cost of reduced ID accuracy; (3) a strong relationship between shift gap (difference between ID and OOD performance) and shifts in the label distribution.1",

Moreover, the impact of the commonly optimized image-based segmentation metrics such as dice score on the estimation of clinical parameters relevant in 2D-3D bone shape reconstruction is not well known. To move closer toward clinical translation, we propose a benchmarking framework that evaluates tasks relevant to real-world clinical scenarios, including reconstruction of fractured bones, bones with implants, robustness to population shift, and error in estimating clinical parameters.

Our results show that attention-based methods that capture global spatial relationships tend to perform better across all anatomies and datasets; performance on clinically relevant subgroups may be overestimated without disaggregated reporting; ribs are substantially more difficult to reconstruct compared to femur, hip and spine; and the dice score improvement does not always bring a corresponding improvement in the automatic estimation of clinically relevant parameters.",

This view tends to diminish the value of preliminary steps like data preprocessing, as more attention is given to newly designed loss functions, network architectures, and learning paradigms. In this paper, we aim to bridge this gap by asking two key questions: (i) Which design choices in deep AD methods are crucial for detecting anomalies?

To address these questions, we introduce ADGym, a platform specifically crafted for comprehensive evaluation and automatic selection of AD design elements in deep methods.

Previous works have designed various deep-learning methods using historical records to predict traffic accident occurrences. However, there is a lack of consensus on how accurate existing methods are, and a fundamental issue is the lack of public accident datasets for comprehensive evaluations. This paper constructs a large-scale, unified dataset of traffic accident records from official reports of various states in the US, totaling 9 million records, accompanied by road networks and traffic volume reports. Using this new dataset, we evaluate existing deep-learning methods for predicting the occurrence of accidents on road networks. Our main finding is that graph neural networks such as GraphSAGE can accurately predict the number of accidents on roads with less than 22% mean absolute error (relative to the actual count) and whether an accident will occur or not with over 87% AUROC, averaged over states. We achieve these results by using multitask learning to account for cross-state variabilities (e.g., availability of accident labels) and transfer learning to combine traffic volume with accident prediction.

        "abstract": "Numerous benchmarks have been established to assess the performance of founda- tion models on open-ended question answering, which serves as a comprehensive test of a model\u2019s ability to understand and generate language in a manner similar to humans. Most of these works focus on proposing new datasets, however, we see two main issues within previous benchmarking pipelines, namely testing leakage and evaluation automation. In this paper, we propose a novel benchmarking frame- work, Language-Model-as-an-Examiner, where the LM serves as a knowledgeable examiner that formulates questions based on its knowledge and evaluates responses in a reference-free manner. Our framework allows for effortless extensibility as various LMs can be adopted as the examiner, and the questions can be constantly updated given more diverse trigger topics. For a more comprehensive and equitable evaluation, we devise three strategies: (1) We instruct the LM examiner to generate questions across a multitude of domains to probe for a broad acquisition, and raise follow-up questions to engage in a more in-depth assessment. (2) Upon evaluation, the examiner combines both scoring and ranking measurements, providing a reli- able result as it aligns closely with human annotations. (3) We additionally propose a decentralized Peer-examination method to address the biases in a single examiner. Our data and benchmarking results are available at: http://lmexam.xlore.cn.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have transformed the field of question answering (QA). However, evaluating LLMs in the medical field is challenging due to the lack of standardized and comprehensive datasets. To address this gap, we introduce CMExam, sourced from the Chinese National Medical Licensing Examination. CMExam consists of 60K+ multiple-choice questions for standardized and objective evaluations, as well as solution explanations for model reasoning evaluation in an open-ended manner. For in-depth analyses of LLMs, we invited medical professionals to label five additional question-wise annotations, including disease groups, clinical departments, medical disciplines, areas of com- petency, and question difficulty levels. Alongside the dataset, we further conducted thorough experiments with representative LLMs and QA algorithms on CMExam. The results show that GPT-4 had the best accuracy of 61.6% and a weighted F1 score of 0.617. These results highlight a great disparity when compared to human accuracy, which stood at 71.6%. For explanation tasks, while LLMs could generate relevant reasoning and demonstrate improved performance after finetuning, they fall short of a desired standard, indicating ample room for improvement. To the best of our knowledge, CMExam is the first Chinese medical exam dataset to pro- vide comprehensive medical annotations. The experiments and findings of LLM evaluation also provide valuable insights into the challenges and potential solutions in developing Chinese medical QA systems and LLM evaluation pipelines.",

Encouraged by the recent surge in computer power and artificial intelligence development, many algorithms have been developed to tackle this problem. However, despite the emer- gence of many new approaches in recent years, comparatively little progress has been made in developing realistic benchmarks that reflect the complexity of molec- ular design for real-world applications. In this work, we develop a set of practical benchmark tasks relying on physical simulation of molecular systems mimicking real-life molecular design problems for materials, drugs, and chemical reactions. Additionally, we demonstrate the utility and ease of use of our new benchmark set by demonstrating how to compare the performance of several well-established families of algorithms. Surprisingly, we find that model performance can strongly depend on the benchmark domain. We believe that our benchmark suite will help move the field towards more realistic molecular design benchmarks, and move the development of inverse molecular design algorithms closer to designing molecules that solve existing problems in both academia and industry alike",

However, despite the recent attempts to assess the Theory-of-Mind (ToM) reasoning capabilities of LLMs, the degree to which these models can align with human ToM remains a nuanced topic of exploration. This is primarily due to two distinct challenges: (1) the presence of inconsistent results from previous evaluations, and (2) concerns surrounding the validity of existing evaluation methodologies. To address these challenges, we present a novel framework for procedurally generating evaluations with LLMs by populating causal templates. Using our framework, we create a new social reasoning benchmark (BigToM) for LLMs which consists of 25 controls and 5,000 model-written evaluations. We find that human participants rate the quality of our benchmark higher than previous crowd-sourced evaluations and comparable to expert-written evaluations. Using BigToM, we evaluate the social reasoning capabilities of a variety of LLMs and compare model performances with human performance. Our results suggest that GPT4 has ToM capabilities that mirror human inference patterns, though less reliable, while other LLMs struggle.2",

In particular, GPT-4 and Claude-2 have shown impressive results in this task. However, most of the prevalent benchmarks, i.e., Spider, and WikiSQL, focus on database schema with few rows of database values leaving the gap between academic study and real-world applications. To mitigate this gap, we present BIRD, a BIg bench for laRge-scale Database grounded in text-to-SQL tasks, containing 12,751 text-to- SQL pairs and 95 databases with a total size of 33.4 GB, spanning 37 professional domains. Our emphasis on database values highlights the new challenges of dirty and noisy database values, external knowledge grounding between NL questions and database values, and SQL efficiency, particularly in the context of massive databases. To solve these problems, text-to-SQL models must feature database value comprehension in addition to semantic parsing. The experimental results demonstrate the significance of database values in generating accurate text-to-SQLs for big databases. Furthermore, even the most effective text-to-SQL models, i.e. GPT-4, only achieve 54.89% in execution accuracy, which is still far from the human result of 92.96%, proving that challenges still stand. We also provide an efficiency analysis to offer insights into generating text-to-efficient-SQLs that are beneficial to industries. We believe that BIRD will contribute to advancing real-world applications of text-to-SQL research. The leaderboard and source code are available: https://bird-bench.github.io/",

In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning, the StarCraft Multi-Agent Challenge (SMAC) has become a popular testbed for the centralised training with decentralised execution paradigm. However, after years of sustained improvement on SMAC, algorithms now achieve near-perfect performance. In this work, we conduct new analysis demonstrating that SMAC lacks the stochasticity and partial observability to require complex closed-loop policies (i.e., those that condition on the observation). In particular, we show that an open-loop policy conditioned only on the timestep can achieve non-trivial win rates for many SMAC scenarios. To address this limitation, we introduce SMACv2, a new benchmark where scenarios are procedurally generated and require agents to generalise to previously unseen settings during evaluation.2 We show that these changes ensure the benchmark requires the use of closed-loop policies. We also introduce the extended partial observability challenge (EPO), which augments SMACv2 to ensure meaningful partial observability. We evaluate state-of-the-art algorithms on SMACv2 and show that it presents significant challenges not present in the original benchmark. Our analysis illustrates that SMACv2 addresses the discovered deficiencies of SMAC and can help benchmark the next generation of MARL methods. Videos of training are available on our website.",

While the latest LLMs are astonishingly fluent when interacting with humans, they suffer from the misinformation problem by unintentionally generating factually false statements. This can lead to harmful consequences, especially when produced within sensitive contexts, such as healthcare. Yet few previous works have fo- cused on evaluating misinformation in the long-form (LF) generation of LLMs, especially for knowledge-intensive topics. Moreover, although LLMs have been shown to perform well in different languages, misinformation evaluation has been mostly conducted in English. To this end, we present a benchmark, CARE-MI, for evaluating LLM misinformation in: 1) a sensitive topic, specifically the maternity and infant care domain; and 2) a language other than English, namely Chinese. Most importantly, we provide an innovative paradigm for building LF generation evaluation benchmarks that can be transferred to other knowledge-intensive do- mains and low-resourced languages. Our proposed benchmark fills the gap between the extensive usage of LLMs and the lack of datasets for assessing the misinfor- mation generated by these models. It contains 1,612 expert-checked questions, accompanied with human-selected references. Using our benchmark, we conduct extensive experiments and found that current Chinese LLMs are far from perfect in the topic of maternity and infant care.

Particular classes of optimization problems in- cluding semi-definite programming (SDP) and linear programming (LP) have wide applicability in many domains of computer science, engineering, mathematics, and physics. Here we focus on semi- definite and linear programs for which the dimensions of the variables involved are exponentially large, so that standard classical SDP and LP solvers are not helpful for such large-scale problems. We propose the QSlack and CSlack methods for estimating their optimal values, respectively, which work by 1) introducing slack variables to transform inequality constraints to equality constraints, 2) transforming a constrained optimization to an unconstrained one via the penalty method, and 3) replacing the optimizations over all possible non-negative variables by optimizations over parame- terized quantum states and parameterized probability distributions. Under the assumption that the SDP and LP inputs are efficiently measurable observables, it follows that all terms in the resulting objective functions are efficiently estimable by either a quantum computer in the SDP case or a quantum or probabilistic computer in the LP case. Furthermore, by making use of SDP and LP duality theory, we prove that these methods provide a theoretical guarantee that, if one could find global optima of the objective functions, then the resulting values sandwich the true optimal values from both above and below. Finally, we showcase the QSlack and CSlack methods on a variety of example optimization problems and discuss details of our implementation, as well as the resulting performance. We find that our implementations of both the primal and dual for these problems approach the ground truth, typically achieving errors of the order 10\u22122.",

        "abstract": "Is it possible to develop an \u201cAI Pathologist\" to pass the board-certified examination of the American Board of Pathology? To achieve this goal, the first step is to create a visual question answering (VQA) dataset where the AI agent is presented with a pathology image together with a question and is asked to give the correct answer. Our work makes the first attempt to build such a dataset. Different from creating general-domain VQA datasets where the images are widely accessible and there are many crowdsourcing workers available and capable of generating question-answer pairs, developing a medical VQA dataset is much more challenging. First, due to privacy concerns, pathology images are usually not publicly available. Second, only well-trained pathologists can understand pathology images, but they barely have time to help create datasets for AI research. To address these challenges, we resort to pathology textbooks and online digital libraries. We develop a semi-automated pipeline to extract pathology images and captions from textbooks and generate question-answer pairs from captions using natural language processing. We collect 32,799 open-ended questions from 4,998 pathology images where each question is manually checked to ensure correctness. To our best knowledge, this is the first dataset for pathology VQA. Our dataset will be released publicly to promote research in medical VQA.",

        "abstract": "Visual object tracking is key to many egocentric vision problems. However, the full spectrum of challenges of egocentric tracking faced by an embodied AI is under- represented in many existing datasets, which tend to focus on short, third-person videos. Egocentric video has several distinguishing characteristics from those com- monly found in past datasets: frequent large camera motions and hand interactions with objects commonly lead to occlusions or objects exiting the frame, and object appearance can change rapidly due to widely different points of view, scale, or object states. Embodied tracking is also naturally long-term, and being able to con- sistently (re-)associate objects to their appearances and disappearances over as long as a lifetime is critical. Previous datasets under-emphasize this re-detection prob- lem, and their \u201cframed\u201d nature has led to adoption of various spatiotemporal priors that we find do not necessarily generalize to egocentric video. We thus introduce EgoTracks, a new dataset for long-term egocentric visual object tracking. Sourced from the Ego4D dataset, EgoTracks presents a significant challenge to recent state- of-the-art single-object trackers, which we find score more poorly on our new dataset than existing popular benchmarks, according to traditional tracking metrics. We further show improvements that can be made to the STARK tracker to signifi- cantly increase its performance on egocentric data, resulting in a baseline model we call EgoSTARK. We publicly release our annotations and benchmark (https:// github.com/EGO4D/episodic-memory/tree/main/EgoTracks), hoping our dataset leads to further advancements in tracking.",

Existing datasets for web agents either use simulated websites or only cover a limited set of websites and tasks, thus not suitable for generalist web agents. With over 2,000 open-ended tasks collected from 137 websites spanning 31 domains and crowdsourced action sequences for the tasks, MIND2WEB pro- vides three necessary ingredients for building generalist web agents: 1) diverse domains, websites, and tasks, 2) use of real-world websites instead of simulated and simplified ones, and 3) a broad spectrum of user interaction patterns. Based on MIND2WEB, we conduct an initial exploration of using large language models (LLMs) for building generalist web agents. While the raw HTML of real-world web- sites are often too large to be fed to LLMs, we show that first filtering it with a small LM significantly improves the effectiveness and efficiency of LLMs. Our solution demonstrates a decent level of performance, even on websites or entire domains the model has never seen before, but there is still a substantial room to improve towards truly generalizable agents. We open-source our dataset, model implementation, and trained models (https://osu-nlp-group.github.io/Mind2Web) to facilitate further research on building a generalist agent for the web.",

Each record is taxonomically classified by an expert, and also has associated genetic information including raw nucleotide barcode sequences and assigned barcode index numbers, which are genetically-based proxies for species classification. This paper presents a curated million-image dataset, primarily to train computer-vision models capa- ble of providing image-based taxonomic assessment, however, the dataset also presents compelling characteristics, the study of which would be of interest to the broader machine learning community. Driven by the biological nature inherent to the dataset, a characteristic long-tailed class-imbalance distribution is exhib- ited. Furthermore, taxonomic labelling is a hierarchical classification scheme, presenting a highly fine-grained classification problem at lower levels. Beyond spurring interest in biodiversity research within the machine learning community, progress on creating an image-based taxonomic classifier will also further the ultimate goal of all BIOSCAN research: to lay the foundation for a comprehensive survey of global biodiversity. This paper introduces the dataset and explores the classification task through the implementation and analysis of a baseline clas- sifier.

While training on ever-larger portions of the internet leads to consistent perfor- mance improvements, the size of these improvements diminishes with scale, and there has been little work exploring the effect of data selection on pre-training and downstream performance beyond simple de-duplication methods such as Min- Hash. Here, we show that careful data selection (on top of de-duplicated data) via pre-trained model embeddings can speed up training (20% efficiency gains) and improves average downstream accuracy on 16 NLP tasks (up to 2%) at the 6.7B model scale. Furthermore, we show that repeating data intelligently consistently outperforms baseline training (while repeating random data performs worse than baseline training). Our results indicate that clever data selection can significantly improve LLM pre-training, calls into question the common practice of training for a single epoch on as much data as possible, and demonstrates a path to keep improving our models past the limits of randomly sampling web data.",

While there are a variety of datasets that capture semantic similarity, they are either constructed from modern web data or are relatively small datasets created in the past decade by human annotators. This study utilizes a novel source, newly digitized articles from off-copyright, local U.S. newspapers, to assemble a massive-scale semantic similarity dataset spanning 70 years from 1920 to 1989 and containing nearly 400M positive semantic similarity pairs. Historically, around half of articles in U.S. local newspapers came from newswires like the Associated Press. While local papers reproduced articles from the newswire, they wrote their own headlines, which form abstractive summaries of the associated articles. We associate articles and their headlines by exploiting document layouts and language understanding. We then use deep neural methods to detect which articles are from the same underlying source, in the presence of substantial noise and abridgement. The headlines of reproduced articles form positive semantic similarity pairs. The resulting publicly available HEADLINES dataset is significantly larger than most existing semantic similarity datasets and covers a much longer span of time. It will facilitate the application of contrastively trained semantic similarity models to a variety of tasks, including the study of semantic change across space and time.",

Advocating for an empirically grounded inductive approach to research, we build an empirical testbed compris- ing natural shifts across 5 tabular datasets and 60,000 method configurations encompassing imbalanced learning methods and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) methods. We find Y |X-shifts are most prevalent on our testbed, in stark contrast to the heavy focus on X\n(covariate)-shifts in the ML literature. The performance of \u201crobust\u201d methods varies significantly over shift types, and is no better than that of vanilla methods. To understand why, we conduct an in-depth empirical analysis of DRO methods and find that although often neglected by researchers, implementation details\u2014such as the choice of underlying model class (e.g., XGBoost) and hyperparameter selection\u2014have a bigger impact on performance than the ambiguity set or its radius.

Several years ago, the default option was an ImageNet-trained convolutional neural network. However, the re- cent past has seen the emergence of countless backbones pretrained using various algorithms and datasets. While this abundance of choice has led to performance increases for a range of systems, it is difficult for practitioners to make informed decisions about which backbone to choose. Battle of the Backbones (BoB) makes this choice easier by benchmarking a diverse suite of pretrained models, including vision-language models, those trained via self-supervised learning, and the Stable Diffusion backbone, across a diverse set of computer vision tasks ranging from clas- sification to object detection to OOD generalization and more. Furthermore, BoB sheds light on promising directions for the research community to advance com- puter vision by illuminating strengths and weakness of existing approaches through a comprehensive analysis conducted on more than 1500 training runs. While vision transformers (ViTs) and self-supervised learning (SSL) are increasingly popular, we find that convolutional neural networks pretrained in a supervised fashion on large training sets still perform best on most tasks among the models we consider.

To this end, we introduce M3Exam, a novel bench- mark sourced from real and official human exam questions for evaluating LLMs in a multilingual, multimodal, and multilevel context. M3Exam exhibits three unique characteristics: (1) multilingualism, encompassing questions from multiple countries that require strong multilingual proficiency and cultural knowledge; (2) multimodality, accounting for the multimodal nature of many exam questions to test the model\u2019s multimodal understanding capability; and (3) multilevel struc- ture, featuring exams from three critical educational periods to comprehensively assess a model\u2019s proficiency at different levels.

        "abstract": "Many of the most commonly explored natural language processing (NLP) informa- tion extraction tasks can be thought of as evaluations of declarative knowledge, or fact-based information extraction. Procedural knowledge extraction, i.e., breaking down a described process into a series of steps, has received much less attention, perhaps in part due to the lack of structured datasets that capture the knowledge ex- traction process from end-to-end. To address this unmet need, we present FlaMB\u00e9 (Flow annotations for Multiverse Biological entities), a collection of expert-curated datasets across a series of complementary tasks that capture procedural knowledge in biomedical texts. This dataset is inspired by the observation that one ubiquitous source of procedural knowledge that is described as unstructured text is within aca- demic papers describing their methodology. The workflows annotated in FlaMB\u00e9 are from texts in the burgeoning field of single cell research, a research area that has become notorious for the number of software tools and complexity of workflows used. Additionally, FlaMB\u00e9 provides, to our knowledge, the largest manually curated named entity recognition (NER) and disambiguation (NED) datasets for tissue/cell type, a fundamental biological entity that is critical for knowledge ex- traction in the biomedical research domain. Beyond providing a valuable dataset to enable further development of NLP models for procedural knowledge extraction, automating the process of workflow mining also has important implications for advancing reproducibility in biomedical research.",

        "abstract": "Estimating camera motion in deformable scenes poses a complex and open research challenge. Most existing non-rigid structure from motion techniques assume to observe also static scene parts besides deforming scene parts in order to establish an anchoring reference. However, this assumption does not hold true in certain relevant application cases such as endoscopies. Deformable odometry and SLAM pipelines, which tackle the most challenging scenario of exploratory trajectories, suffer from a lack of robustness and proper quantitative evaluation methodolo- gies. To tackle this issue with a common benchmark, we introduce the Drunkard\u2019s Dataset, a challenging collection of synthetic data targeting visual navigation and reconstruction in deformable environments. This dataset is the first large set of exploratory camera trajectories with ground truth inside 3D scenes where every surface exhibits non-rigid deformations over time. Simulations in realistic 3D build- ings lets us obtain a vast amount of data and ground truth labels, including camera poses, RGB images and depth, optical flow and normal maps at high resolution and quality. We further present a novel deformable odometry method, dubbed the Drunkard\u2019s Odometry, which decomposes optical flow estimates into rigid-body camera motion and non-rigid scene deformations. In order to validate our data, our work contains an evaluation of several baselines as well as a novel tracking error metric which does not require ground truth data.

        "title": "Physion++: Evaluating Physical Scene Understanding that Requires Online Inference of Different Physical Properties",
        "abstract": "General physical scene understanding requires more than simply localizing and recognizing objects \u2013 it requires knowledge that objects can have different latent properties (e.g., mass or elasticity), and that those properties affect the outcome of physical events. While there has been great progress in physical and video prediction models in recent years, benchmarks to test their performance typically do not require an understanding that objects have individual physical properties, or at best test only those properties that are directly observable (e.g., size or color). This work proposes a novel dataset and benchmark, termed Physion++, that rigorously evaluates visual physical prediction in artificial systems under circumstances where those predictions rely on accurate estimates of the latent physical properties of objects in the scene. Specifically, we test scenarios where accurate prediction relies on estimates of properties such as mass, friction, elasticity, and deformability, and where the values of those properties can only be inferred by observing how objects move and interact with other objects or fluids. We evaluate the performance of a number of state-of-the-art prediction models that span a variety of levels of learning vs. built-in knowledge, and compare that performance to a set of human predictions. We find that models that have been trained using standard regimes and datasets do not spontaneously learn to make inferences about latent properties, but also that models that encode objectness and physical states tend to make better predictions. However, there is still a huge gap between all models and human performance, and all models\u2019 predictions correlate poorly with those made by humans, suggesting that no state-of-the-art model is learning to make physical predictions in a human- like way. These results show that current deep learning models that succeed in some settings nevertheless fail to achieve human-level physical prediction in other cases, especially those where latent property inference is required.

        "abstract": "The emergence of foundation models in Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing have resulted in immense progress on downstream tasks. This progress was enabled by datasets with billions of training examples. Similar benefits are yet to be unlocked for quantum chemistry, where the potential of deep learning is constrained by comparatively small datasets with 100k to 20M training examples. These datasets are limited in size because the labels are computed using the accurate (but computationally demanding) predictions of Density Functional Theory (DFT). Notably, prior DFT datasets were created using CPU supercomputers without leveraging hardware acceleration. In this paper, we take a first step towards utilising hardware accelerators by introducing the data generator PySCFIPU using Intelligence Processing Units (IPUs). This allowed us to create the dataset QM1B with one billion training examples containing 9-11 heavy atoms. We demonstrate that a simple baseline neural network (SchNet 9M) improves its performance by simply increasing the amount of training data without additional inductive biases. To encourage future researchers to use QM1B responsibly, we highlight several limitations of QM1B and emphasise the low-resolution of our DFT options, which also serves as motivation for even larger, more accurate datasets.

Specifically, we propose a new dataset for measuring AI-human visual alignment in terms of image classification, a fundamental task in machine perception. In order to evaluate AI-human visual alignment, a dataset should encompass samples with various scenarios that may arise in the real world and have gold human perception labels. Our dataset consists of three groups of samples, namely Must-Act (i.e., Must-Classify), Must-Abstain, and Uncertain, based on the quantity and clarity of visual information in an image and further divided into eight categories. All samples have a gold human perception label; even Uncertain (e.g., severely blurry) sample labels were obtained via crowd- sourcing. The validity of our dataset is verified by sampling theory, statistical theories related to survey design, and experts in the related fields.

A desirable algorithm should precisely predict fire risk and magnitude for a location in real time. In this paper, we develop a flexible spatio-temporal wildfire prediction framework using multi-modal time series data. We first predict the wildfire risk (the chance of a wildfire event) in real-time, considering the historical events using discrete mutually exciting point process models. Then we further develop a wildfire magnitude prediction set method based on the flexible distribution-free time-series conformal prediction (CP) approach. Theoretically, we prove a risk model parameter recovery guarantee, as well as coverage and set size guarantees for the CP sets.

Each data set is derived from a library of formalized mathematics written in proof assistants Agda or Lean. The collection includes the largest Lean 4 library Mathlib, and some of the largest Agda libraries: the standard library, the library of univalent mathematics Agda-unimath, and the TypeTopology library. Each data set represents the corresponding library in two ways: as a heterogeneous network, and as a list of s-expressions representing the syntax trees of all the entries in the library. The network contains the (modular) structure of the library and the references between entries, while the s-expressions give complete and easily parsed information about every entry. We report baseline results using standard graph and word embeddings, tree ensembles, and instance-based learning algorithms. The MLFMF data sets provide solid benchmarking support for further investigation of the numerous machine learning approaches to formalized mathematics.

In computer vision specifically, we have relied on datasets augmented with perceived attribute signals (e.g., gender presentation, skin tone, and age) and benchmarks enabled by these datasets. Typically labels for these tasks come from human annotators. However, annotating attribute signals, especially skin tone, is a difficult and subjective task. Perceived skin tone is affected by technical factors, like lighting conditions, and social factors that shape an annotator\u2019s lived experience.\nThis paper examines the subjectivity of skin tone annotation through a series of annotation experiments using the Monk Skin Tone (MST) scale [59], a small pool of professional photographers, and a much larger pool of trained crowdsourced annotators. Along with this study we release the Monk Skin Tone Examples (MST- E) dataset, containing 1515 images and 31 videos spread across the full MST scale. MST-E is designed to help train human annotators to annotate MST effectively. Our study shows that annotators can reliably annotate skin tone in a way that aligns with an expert in the MST scale, even under challenging environmental conditions. We also find evidence that annotators from different geographic regions rely on different mental models of MST categories resulting in annotations that systematically vary across regions. Given this, we advise practitioners to use a diverse set of annotators and a higher replication count for each image when annotating skin tone for fairness research.",

Despite remarkable progress in recent years, a lack of systematic understanding persists due to the diverse settings, complex implementation, and difficult reproducibility. Without standardization, comparisons can be unfair and insights inconclusive. To address this dilemma, we propose OpenSTL, a comprehensive benchmark for spatio-temporal predictive learning that categorizes prevalent approaches into recurrent-based and recurrent-free models. OpenSTL provides a modular and extensible framework implementing various state-of-the-art methods. We conduct standard evaluations on datasets across various domains, including synthetic moving object trajectory, human motion, driving scenes, traffic flow, and weather forecasting. Based on our observations, we provide a detailed analysis of how model architecture and dataset properties affect spatio-temporal predictive learning performance. Surprisingly, we find that recurrent-free models achieve a good balance between efficiency and performance than recurrent models. Thus, we further extend the common MetaFormers to boost recurrent-free spatial-temporal predictive learning. We open-source the code and models at https://github.com/chengtan9907/OpenSTL.Most neural networks assume that input images have a fixed number of channels (three for RGB images).

We show that current object detection models can be leveraged to evaluate text-to-image models on a variety of generation tasks with strong human agreement, and that other discriminative vision models can be linked to this pipeline to further verify properties like object color. We then evaluate several open- source text-to-image models and analyze their relative generative capabilities on our benchmark. We find that recent models demonstrate significant improvement on these tasks, though they are still lacking in complex capabilities such as spatial relations and attribute binding. Finally, we demonstrate how GENEVAL might be used to help discover existing failure modes, in order to inform development of the next generation of text-to-image models.

We propose a search and pruning (SnP) solution to this training data search prob- lem, tailored to object re-identification (re-ID), an appli- cation aiming to match the same object captured by differ- ent cameras. Specifically, the search stage identifies and merges clusters of source identities which exhibit similar distributions with the target domain. The second stage, subject to a budget, then selects identities and their im- ages from the Stage I output, to control the size of the re- sulting training set for efficient training. The two steps provide us with training sets 80% smaller than the source pool while achieving a similar or even higher re-ID accu- racy. These training sets are also shown to be superior to a few existing search methods such as random sampling and greedy sampling under the same budget on training data size. If we release the budget, training sets resulting from the first stage alone allow even higher re-ID accu- racy. We provide interesting discussions on the specificity of our method to the re-ID problem and particularly its role in bridging the re-ID domain gap.

Existing DD methods based on gradient matching achieve leading performance; however, they are extremely computationally intensive as they re- quire continuously optimizing a dataset among thousands of randomly initialized models. In this paper, we assume that training the synthetic data with diverse models leads to better generalization performance. Thus we propose two model augmentation techniques, i.e. using early-stage models and parameter perturbation to learn an informative synthetic set with significantly reduced training cost. Exten- sive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves up to 20\u00d7 speedup and comparable performance on par with state-of-the-art methods.",

        "title": "ImageNet-E: Benchmarking Neural Network Robustness via Attribute Editing",
        "abstract": "Recent studies have shown that higher accuracy on Im- ageNet usually leads to better robustness against differ- ent corruptions. Therefore, in this paper, instead of fol- lowing the traditional research paradigm that investigates new out-of-distribution corruptions or perturbations deep models may encounter, we conduct model debugging in in- distribution data to explore which object attributes a model may be sensitive to. To achieve this goal, we create a toolkit for object editing with controls of backgrounds, sizes, po- sitions, and directions, and create a rigorous benchmark named ImageNet-E(diting) for evaluating the image clas- sifier robustness in terms of object attributes. With our ImageNet-E, we evaluate the performance of current deep learning models, including both convolutional neural net- works and vision transformers. We find that most models are quite sensitive to attribute changes. A small change in the background can lead to an average of 9.23% drop on top-1 accuracy. We also evaluate some robust models including both adversarially trained models and other ro- bust trained models and find that some models show worse robustness against attribute changes than vanilla models. Based on these findings, we discover ways to enhance at- tribute robustness with preprocessing, architecture designs, and training strategies. We hope this work can provide some insights to the community and open up a new av- enue for research in robust computer vision.

        "abstract": "Formula-driven supervised learning (FDSL) has been shown to be an effective method for pre-training vision transformers, where ExFractalDB-21k was shown to exceed the pre-training effect of ImageNet-21k. These studies also indicate that contours mattered more than textures when pre-training vision transformers. However, the lack of a systematic investigation as to why these contour-oriented synthetic datasets can achieve the same accuracy as real datasets leaves much room for skepticism. In the present work, we develop a novel methodology based on circular harmonics for systematically investigating the design space of contour-oriented synthetic datasets. This allows us to efficiently search the optimal range of FDSL parameters and maximize the variety of synthetic images in the dataset, which we found to be a critical factor. When the resulting new dataset VisualAtom-21k is used for pre-training ViT- Base, the top-1 accuracy reached 83.7% when fine-tuning on ImageNet-1k. This is close to the top-1 accuracy (84.2%) achieved by JFT-300M pre-training, while the number of images is 1/14. Unlike JFT-300M which is a static dataset, the quality of synthetic datasets will continue to improve, and the current work is a testament to this possibility. FDSL is also free of the common issues associated with real im- ages, e.g. privacy/copyright issues, labeling costs/errors, and ethical biases.",

Most of the current stud- ies rely on large-scale datasets (e.g., AVA and AADB) to learn a general model for all kinds of photography images. However, little light has been shed on measuring the aes- thetic quality of artistic images, and the existing datasets only contain relatively few artworks. Such a defect is a great obstacle to the aesthetic assessment of artistic images. To fill the gap in the field of artistic image aesthetics assess- ment (AIAA), we first introduce a large-scale AIAA dataset: Boldbrush Artistic Image Dataset (BAID), which consists of 60,337 artistic images covering various art forms, with more than 360,000 votes from online users. We then pro- pose a new method, SAAN (Style-specific Art Assessment Network), which can effectively extract and utilize style- specific and generic aesthetic information to evaluate artis- tic images. Experiments demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms existing IAA methods on the pro- posed BAID dataset according to quantitative comparisons. We believe the proposed dataset and method can serve as a foundation for future AIAA works and inspire more re- search in this field.

An important practi- cal problem pertains to models deployed in a new geography that is under-represented in the training dataset, posing a direct challenge to fair and inclusive computer vision. In this paper, we study the problem of geographic robust- ness and make three main contributions. First, we intro- duce a large-scale dataset GeoNet for geographic adapta- tion containing benchmarks across diverse tasks like scene recognition (GeoPlaces), image classification (GeoImNet) and universal adaptation (GeoUniDA). Second, we inves- tigate the nature of distribution shifts typical to the prob- lem of geographic adaptation and hypothesize that the ma- jor source of domain shifts arise from significant varia- tions in scene context (context shift), object design (de- sign shift) and label distribution (prior shift) across ge- ographies. Third, we conduct an extensive evaluation of several state-of-the-art unsupervised domain adaptation al- gorithms and architectures on GeoNet, showing that they do not suffice for geographical adaptation, and that large-scale pre-training using large vision models also does not lead to geographic robustness.

We have created a new, more descriptive facial hair annotation scheme and applied it to create a new facial hair attribute dataset, FH37K. Face attribute research also so far has not dealt with logical consistency and completeness. For ex- ample, in prior research, an image might be classified as both having no beard and also having a goatee (a type of beard). We show that the test accuracy of previous classifi- cation methods on facial hair attribute classification drops significantly if logical consistency of classifications is en- forced. We propose a logically consistent prediction loss, LCPLoss, to aid learning of logical consistency across at- tributes, and also a label compensation training strategy to eliminate the problem of no positive prediction across a set of related attributes. Using an attribute classifier trained on FH37K, we investigate how facial hair affects face recognition accuracy, including variation across de- mographics. Results show that similarity and difference in facial hairstyle have important effects on the impostor and genuine score distributions in face recognition.

We show, with appropriate specification of moment conditions, that the proposed method can identify which modes have been dropped, the degree to which DGMs are mode imbalanced, and whether DGMs sufficiently capture intra-class diversity. We show how to combine techniques from Maximum Mean Discrepancy and Generalized Empiri- cal Likelihood to create not only distribution tests that retain per-sample interpretability, but also metrics that include la- bel information.

The clothing is realistically simulated on the moving bodies using commercial clothing physics simulation. We render varying numbers of people in realistic scenes with varied lighting and camera motions. We then train vari- ous HPS regressors using BEDLAM and achieve state-of- the-art accuracy on real-image benchmarks despite train- ing with synthetic data. We use BEDLAM to gain insights\ninto what model design choices are important for accu- racy. With good synthetic training data, we find that a basic method like HMR approaches the accuracy of the current SOTA method (CLIFF). BEDLAM is useful for a variety of tasks and all images, ground truth bodies, 3D clothing, support code, and more are available for research purposes. Additionally, we provide detailed information about our synthetic data generation pipeline, enabling oth- ers to generate their own datasets. See the project page: https://bedlam.is.tue.mpg.de/.",

        "abstract": "We aim at advancing blind image quality assessment (BIQA), which predicts the human perception of image quality without any reference information. We develop a general and automated multitask learning scheme for BIQA to exploit auxiliary knowledge from other tasks, in a way that the model parameter sharing and the loss weighting are determined automatically. Specifically, we first describe all candidate label combinations (from multiple tasks) us- ing a textual template, and compute the joint probability from the cosine similarities of the visual-textual embed- dings. Predictions of each task can be inferred from the joint distribution, and optimized by carefully designed loss functions. Through comprehensive experiments on learn- ing three tasks - BIQA, scene classification, and distor- tion type identification, we verify that the proposed BIQA method 1) benefits from the scene classification and dis- tortion type identification tasks and outperforms the state- of-the-art on multiple IQA datasets, 2) is more robust in the group maximum differentiation competition, and 3) re- aligns the quality annotations from different IQA datasets more effectively.

        "abstract": "In this work, we explore the emotional reactions that real-world images tend to induce by using natural language as the medium to express the rationale behind an affective response to a given visual stimulus. To embark on this journey, we introduce and share with the research community a large-scale dataset that contains emotional reactions and free-form textual explanations for 85,007 publicly available images, analyzed by 6,283 annotators who were asked to indicate and explain how and why they felt in a particular way when observing a particular image, producing a total of 526,749 responses. Even though emotional reactions are subjective and sensitive to context (personal mood, social status, past experiences) \u2013 we show that there is significant common ground to capture potentially plausible emotional responses with a large support in the subject population. In light of this key observation, we ask the following questions: i) Can we develop multi-modal neural networks that provide reasonable affective responses to real-world visual data, explained with language? ii) Can we steer such methods towards producing explanations with varying degrees of pragmatic language or justifying different emotional reactions while adapting to the underlying visual stimulus? Finally, iii) How can we evaluate the performance of such methods for this novel task? With this work, we take the first steps in addressing all of these questions, thus paving the way for richer, more human-centric, and emotionally-aware image analysis systems.

        "abstract": "We have seen a great progress in video action recognition in recent years. There are several models based on convolutional neural network (CNN) and some recent transformer based approaches which provide top performance on existing benchmarks. In this work, we perform a large-scale robustness analysis of these existing models for video action recognition. We focus on robustness against real- world distribution shift perturbations instead of adversarial perturbations. We propose four different benchmark datasets, HMDB51-P, UCF101-P, Kinetics400-P, and SSv2-P to perform this analysis. We study robustness of six state-of-the-art action recognition models against 90 different perturbations. The study reveals some interesting findings, 1) transformer based models are consistently more robust compared to CNN based models, 2) Pretraining improves robustness for Transformer based models more than CNN based models, and 3) All of the studied models are robust to temporal perturbations for all datasets but SSv2; suggesting the importance of temporal information for action recognition varies based on the dataset and activities. Next, we study the role of augmentations in model robustness and present a real-world dataset, UCF101-DS, which contains realistic distribution shifts, to further validate some of these findings. We believe this study will serve as a benchmark for future research in robust video action recognition",

        "abstract": "Monitoring animal behavior can facilitate conservation efforts by providing key insights into wildlife health, popula- tion status, and ecosystem function. Automatic recognition of animals and their behaviors is critical for capitalizing on the large unlabeled datasets generated by modern video devices and for accelerating monitoring efforts at scale. However, the development of automated recognition systems is cur- rently hindered by a lack of appropriately labeled datasets. Existing video datasets 1) do not classify animals according to established biological taxonomies; 2) are too small to fa- cilitate large-scale behavioral studies and are often limited to a single species; and 3) do not feature temporally localized annotations and therefore do not facilitate localization of targeted behaviors within longer video sequences. Thus, we propose MammalNet, a new large-scale animal behav- ior dataset with taxonomy-guided annotations of mammals and their common behaviors. MammalNet contains over 18K videos totaling 539 hours, which is \u223c10 times larger than the largest existing animal behavior dataset [36]. It covers 17 orders, 69 families, and 173 mammal categories for animal categorization and captures 12 high-level animal behaviors that received focus in previous animal behavior studies. We establish three benchmarks on MammalNet: standard animal and behavior recognition, compositional low-shot animal and behavior recognition, and behavior detection.

        "abstract": "Visual localization is a core component in many applica- tions, including augmented reality (AR). Localization algo- rithms compute the camera pose of a query image w.r.t. a scene representation, which is typically built from images. This often requires capturing and storing large amounts of data, followed by running Structure-from-Motion (SfM) algorithms. An in- teresting, and underexplored, source of data for building scene representations are 3D models that are readily available on the Internet, e.g., hand-drawn CAD models, 3D models generated from building footprints, or from aerial images. These mod- els allow to perform visual localization right away without the time-consuming scene capturing and model building steps. Yet, it also comes with challenges as the available 3D models are of- ten imperfect reflections of reality. E.g., the models might only have generic or no textures at all, might only provide a simple approximation of the scene geometry, or might be stretched. This paper studies how the imperfections of these models af- fect localization accuracy. We create a new benchmark for this task and provide a detailed experimental evaluation based on multiple 3D models per scene. We show that 3D models from the Internet show promise as an easy-to-obtain scene represen- tation. At the same time, there is significant room for improve- ment for visual localization pipelines. To foster research on this interesting and challenging task, we release our benchmark at v-pnk.github.io/cadloc.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in machine learning and computer vi- sion are revolutionizing the field of animal behavior by en- abling researchers to track the poses and locations of freely moving animals without any marker attachment. However, large datasets of annotated images of animals for marker- less pose tracking, especially high-resolution images taken from multiple angles with accurate 3D annotations, are still scant. Here, we propose a method that uses a motion cap- ture (mo-cap) system to obtain a large amount of annotated data on animal movement and posture (2D and 3D) in a semi-automatic manner. Our method is novel in that it ex- tracts the 3D positions of morphological keypoints (e.g eyes, beak, tail) in reference to the positions of markers attached to the animals. Using this method, we obtained, and offer here, a new dataset - 3D-POP with approximately 300k an- notated frames (4 million instances) in the form of videos having groups of one to ten freely moving birds from 4 dif- ferent camera views in a 3.6m x 4.2m area. 3D-POP is the first dataset of flocking birds with accurate keypoint annota- tions in 2D and 3D along with bounding box and individual identities and will facilitate the development of solutions for problems of 2D to 3D markerless pose, trajectory tracking, and identification in birds.",

        "abstract": "Year after year, the demand for ever-better smartphone photos continues to grow, in particular in the domain of portrait photography. Manufacturers thus use perceptual quality criteria throughout the development of smartphone cameras. This costly procedure can be partially replaced by automated learning-based methods for image quality as- sessment (IQA). Due to its subjective nature, it is necessary to estimate and guarantee the consistency of the IQA pro- cess, a characteristic lacking in the mean opinion scores (MOS) widely used for crowdsourcing IQA. In addition, existing blind IQA (BIQA) datasets pay little attention to the difficulty of cross-content assessment, which may de- grade the quality of annotations. This paper introduces PIQ23, a portrait-specific IQA dataset of 5116 images of 50 predefined scenarios acquired by 100 smartphones, cov- ering a high variety of brands, models, and use cases. The dataset includes individuals of various genders and ethnic- ities who have given explicit and informed consent for their photographs to be used in public research. It is annotated by pairwise comparisons (PWC) collected from over 30 im- age quality experts for three image attributes: face detail preservation, face target exposure, and overall image qual- ity. An in-depth statistical analysis of these annotations allows us to evaluate their consistency over PIQ23. Fi- nally, we show through an extensive comparison with ex- isting baselines that semantic information (image context) can be used to improve IQA predictions.

LiveChat is automati- cally constructed by processing numerous live videos on the Internet and naturally falls within the scope of multi-party conversations, where the issues of Who says What to Whom should be considered. Therefore, we target two criti- cal tasks of response modeling and addressee recognition and propose retrieval-based base- lines grounded on advanced techniques. Ex- perimental results have validated the positive effects of leveraging persona profiles and larger average sessions per persona. In addition, we also benchmark the transferability of advanced generation-based models on LiveChat and pose some future directions for current challenges.",

        "abstract": "Image quality assessment (IQA) is very important for both end-users and service providers since a high-quality image can significantly improve the user\u2019s quality of experience (QoE) and also benefit lots of computer vision algorithms. Most existing blind image quality assessment (BIQA) models were developed for synthetically distorted images, however, they perform poorly on in-the-wild images, which are widely existed in various practical applications. In this paper, we propose a novel BIQA model for in-the-wild images by addressing two critical problems in this field: how to learn better quality-aware feature representation, and how to solve the problem of insufficient training samples in terms of their content and distortion diversity. Considering that perceptual visual quality is affected by both low-level visual features (e.g. distortions) and high-level semantic information (e.g. content), we first propose a staircase structure to hierarchically integrate the features from intermediate layers into the final feature representation, which enables the model to make full use of visual information from low-level to high- level. Then an iterative mixed database training (IMDT) strategy is proposed to train the BIQA model on multiple databases simultaneously, so the model can benefit from the increase in both training samples and image content and distortion diversity and can learn a more general feature representation. Experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms other state- of-the-art BIQA models on six in-the-wild IQA databases by a large margin. Moreover, the proposed model shows an excellent performance in the cross-database evaluation experiments, which further demonstrates that the learned feature representation is robust to images with diverse distortions and content.

One line of research focuses on translating natural language descriptions of plan- ning tasks into structured planning languages, such as the planning domain defini- tion language (PDDL). While this approach is promising, accurately measuring the quality of generated PDDL code continues to pose significant challenges. First, generated PDDL code is typically evaluated using planning validators that check whether the problem can be solved with a planner. This method is insufficient because a language model might generate valid PDDL code that does not align with the natural language description of the task. Second, existing evaluation sets often have natural language descriptions of the planning task that closely resemble the ground truth PDDL, reducing the challenge of the task. To bridge this gap, we introduce Planetarium, a benchmark designed to evaluate language models\u2019 ability to generate PDDL code from natural language descriptions of planning tasks.

Traditional explicit methods in LM rely on the point spread function (PSF) during image acquisition. Yet, these approaches often fall short due to inaccurate PSF models and noise artifacts, hampering the overall restoration quality. In this paper, we approached the optic decon- volution as an inverse problem. Motivated by the nonstandard-form com- pression scheme introduced by Beylkin, Coifman, and Rokhlin (BCR), we proposed an innovative physics-informed neural network Multi-Stage Residual-BCR Net (m-rBCR) to approximate the optic deconvolution. We validated the m-rBCR model on four microscopy datasets - two sim- ulated microscopy datasets from ImageNet and BioSR, real dSTORM microscopy images, and real widefield microscopy images. In contrast to the explicit deconvolution methods (e.g. Richardson-Lucy) and other state-of-the-art NN models (U-Net, DDPM, CARE, DnCNN, ESRGAN, RCAN, Noise2Noise, MPRNet, and MIMO-U-Net), the m-rBCR model demonstrates superior performance to other candidates by PSNR and SSIM in two real microscopy datasets and the simulated BioSR dataset. In the simulated ImageNet dataset, m-rBCR ranks the second-best place (right after MIMO-U-Net). With the backbone from the optical physics, m-rBCR exploits the trainable parameters with better performances (from \u223c30 times fewer than the benchmark MIMO-U-Net to \u223c210 times than ESRGAN). This enables m-rBCR to achieve a shorter runtime (from \u223c3 times faster than MIMO-U-Net to \u223c300 times faster than DDPM). To summarize, by leveraging physics constraints our model re- duced potentially redundant parameters significantly in expertise-oriented NN candidates and achieved high efficiency with superior performance.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a neat yet effective transformer- based framework for visual grounding, namely TransVG, to address the task of grounding a language query to the corresponding region onto an image. The state-of-the-art methods, including two-stage or one-stage ones, rely on a complex module with manually-designed mechanisms to perform the query reasoning and multi-modal fusion. How- ever, the involvement of certain mechanisms in fusion mod- ule design, such as query decomposition and image scene graph, makes the models easily overfit to datasets with spe- cific scenarios, and limits the plenitudinous interaction be- tween the visual-linguistic context. To avoid this caveat, we propose to establish the multi-modal correspondence by leveraging transformers, and empirically show that the complex fusion modules (e.g., modular attention network, dynamic graph, and multi-modal tree) can be replaced by a simple stack of transformer encoder layers with higher per- formance. Moreover, we re-formulate the visual grounding as a direct coordinates regression problem and avoid mak- ing predictions out of a set of candidates (i.e., region pro- posals or anchor boxes). Extensive experiments are con- ducted on five widely used datasets, and a series of state- of-the-art records are set by our TransVG. We build the benchmark of transformer-based visual grounding frame- work and make the code available at https://github. com/djiajunustc/TransVG.",

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a comprehensive study on semantic segmentation with the Pascal VOC dataset. Here, we have to label each pixel with a class which in turn segments the entire image based on the objects/entities present. To tackle this, we firstly use a Fully Convolution Network (FCN) baseline which gave 71.31% pixel accuracy and 0.0527 mean IoU. We analyze its performance and working and subsequently address the issues in the baseline with three improvements - a) cosine annealing learning rate scheduler(pixel accuracy: 72.86%, IoU: 0.0529), b) data augmentation(pixel accuracy: 69.88%, IoU: 0.0585) c) class imbalance weights(pixel accuracy: 68.98%, IoU: 0.0596). Apart from these changes in train- ing pipeline, we also explore three different architectures - a) Our proposed model - Advanced FCN (pixel accuracy: 67.20%, IoU: 0.0602) b) Transfer Learning with ResNet (Best performance) (pixel accuracy: 71.33%, IoU: 0.0926 ) c) U- Net(pixel accuracy: 72.15%, IoU: 0.0649). We observe that the improvements help in greatly improving the performance, as reflected both, in metrics and seg- mentation maps. Interestingly, we observe that among the improvements, dataset augmentation has the greatest contribution. Also, note that transfer learning model performs the best on the pascal dataset. We analyse the performance of these using loss, accuracy and IoU plots along with segmentation maps, which help us draw valuable insights about the working of the models.",

        "abstract": "Analyzing model performance in various unseen environments is a critical research problem in the machine learning community. To study this problem, it is important to construct a testbed with out-of-distribution test sets that have broad coverage of environmental discrepancies. However, existing testbeds typically either have a small number of domains or are synthesized by image corruptions, hindering algo- rithm design that demonstrates real-world effectiveness. In this paper, we introduce CIFAR-10-Warehouse, consisting of 180 datasets collected by prompting image search engines and diffusion models in various ways. Generally sized between 300 and 8,000 images, the datasets contain natural images, cartoons, certain colors, or objects that do not naturally appear. With CIFAR-10-W, we aim to enhance the evaluation and deepen the understanding of two generalization tasks: domain gener- alization and model accuracy prediction in various out-of-distribution environments. We conduct extensive benchmarking and comparison experiments and show that CIFAR-10-W offers new and interesting insights inherent to these tasks. We also discuss other fields that would benefit from CIFAR-10-W. Data and code are avail- able at https://sites.google.com/view/CIFAR-10-warehouse/.",

        "abstract": "Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding (SSVG) is a new chal- lenge for its sparse labeled data with the need for multimodel under- standing. A previous study, RefTeacher [30], makes the first attempt to tackle this task by adopting the teacher-student framework to provide pseudo confidence supervision and attention-based supervision. However, this approach is incompatible with current state-of-the-art visual ground- ing models, which follow the Transformer-based pipeline. These pipelines directly regress results without region proposals or foreground binary classification, rendering them unsuitable for fitting in RefTeacher due to the absence of confidence scores. Furthermore, the geometric difference in teacher and student inputs, stemming from different data augmentations, induces natural misalignment in attention-based constraints. To estab- lish a compatible SSVG framework, our paper proposes the ACTive REtraining approach for Semi-Supervised Visual Grounding, abbrevi- ated as ACTRESS. Initially, the model is enhanced by incorporating an additional quantized detection head to expose its detection confi- dence. Building upon this, ACTRESS consists of an active sampling strategy and a selective retraining strategy. The active sampling strategy iteratively selects high-quality pseudo labels by evaluating three crucial aspects: Faithfulness, Robustness, and Confidence, optimizing the uti- lization of unlabeled data. The selective retraining strategy retrains the model with periodic re-initialization of specific parameters, facilitating the model\u2019s escape from local minima.

        "title": "Bridging Social Media via Distant Supervision",
        "abstract": "Microblog classification has received a lot of attention in recent years. Different classification tasks have been investigated, most of them fo- cusing on classifying microblogs into a small number of classes (five or less) using a training set of manually annotated tweets. Unfortunately, labelling data is tedious and expensive, and finding tweets that cover all the classes of interest is not always straightforward, especially when some of the classes do not frequently arise in practice. In this paper we study an approach to tweet classification based on distant supervision, whereby we automatically transfer labels from one social medium to another for a single-label multi-class classi- fication task. In particular, we apply YouTube video classes to tweets linking to these videos. This provides for free a virtually unlimited number of labelled instances that can be used as training data. The classification experiments we have run show that training a tweet classifier via these automatically labelled data achieves substantially better performance than training the same clas- sifier with a limited amount of manually labelled data; this is advantageous, given that the automatically labelled data come at no cost. Further investiga- tion of our approach shows its robustness when applied with different numbers of classes and across different languages",

        "abstract": "Every activity in disaster management such as managing evacu- ation plan, and running rescue missions demands accurate and up-to-date information to allow a quick, easy, and cost-effective response to reduce the possible loss of lives and properties. It is a challenging and complex task to acquire information from different regions of a disaster-affected area in a timely fashion. The exten- sive spread and reach of social media and networks allow people to share information in real-time. However, the processing of social media data and gathering of valuable information require a series of operations such as (1) processing each specific tweet for a text classi- fication, (2) possible location determination of people needing help based on tweets, and (3) priority calculations of rescue tasks based on the classification of tweets. These are three primary challenges in developing an effective rescue scheduling operation using social media data. In this paper, first, we propose a deep learning model combining attention based Bi-directional Long Short-Term Mem- ory (BLSTM) and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify the tweets under different categories. We use pre-trained crisis word vectors and global vectors for word representation (GLoVe) for capturing semantic meaning from tweets. Next, we perform feature engineering to create an auxiliary feature map which dra- matically increases the model accuracy. In our experiments using real data sets from Hurricanes Harvey and Irma, it is observed that our proposed approach performs better compared to other classifi- cation methods based on Precision, Recall, F1-score, and Accuracy, and is highly effective to determine the correct priority of a tweet. Furthermore, to evaluate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed classification model a merged dataset comprises of 4 dif- ferent datasets from CrisisNLP and another 15 different disasters data from CrisisLex are used. Finally, we develop an adaptive multi- task hybrid scheduling algorithm considering resource constraints to perform an effective rescue scheduling operation considering different rescue priorities.",

Since Open Images contains many more classes than COCO, nearly 400 object classes seen in test images have no or very few associated training captions (hence, nocaps).

        "abstract": "Problems at the intersection of vision and language are of significant importance both as challenging research questions and for the rich set of applications they enable. However, inherent structure in our world and bias in our language tend to be a simpler signal for learning than vi- sual modalities, resulting in models that ignore visual infor- mation, leading to an inflated sense of their capability.\nWe propose to counter these language priors for the task of Visual Question Answering (VQA) and make vision (the V in VQA) matter! Specifically, we balance the popular VQA dataset [3] by collecting complementary images such that every question in our balanced dataset is associated with not just a single image, but rather a pair of similar images that result in two different answers to the question. Our dataset is by construction more balanced than the origi- nal VQA dataset and has approximately twice the number of image-question pairs. Our complete balanced dataset is publicly available at http://visualqa.org/ as part of the 2nd iteration of the Visual Question Answering Dataset and Challenge (VQA v2.0).\nWe further benchmark a number of state-of-art VQA models on our balanced dataset. All models perform sig- nificantly worse on our balanced dataset, suggesting that these models have indeed learned to exploit language pri- ors. This finding provides the first concrete empirical evi- dence for what seems to be a qualitative sense among prac- titioners.\nFinally, our data collection protocol for identifying com- plementary images enables us to develop a novel inter- pretable model, which in addition to providing an answer to the given (image, question) pair, also provides a counter- example based explanation. Specifically, it identifies an im- age that is similar to the original image, but it believes has a different answer to the same question.

While current open-source LVLMs demonstrate promising performance in simpli- fied scenarios such as single-turn single-image input, they fall short in real-world conversation scenarios such as following instructions in a long context history with multi-turn and multi-images. Existing LVLM benchmarks primarily focus on single-choice questions or short-form responses, which do not adequately as- sess the capabilities of LVLMs in real-world human-AI interaction applications. Therefore, we introduce MMDU, a comprehensive benchmark, and MMDU-45k, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset, designed to evaluate and improve LVLMs\u2019 abilities in multi-turn and multi-image conversations.

To tackle this issue of extracting knowledge fea- tures from long text lessons and merging them with visual features, we establish a context graph from texts and images, and propose a new module f-GCN based on graph con- volutional networks (GCN). Second, scien- tific terms are not spread over the chapters and subjects are split in the TQA dataset. To overcome this so called \u2018out-of-domain\u2019 is- sue, before learning QA problems, we intro- duce a novel self-supervised open-set learn- ing process without any annotations. The ex- perimental results show that our model signifi- cantly outperforms prior state-of-the-art meth- ods. Moreover, ablation studies validate that both methods of incorporating f-GCN for ex- tracting knowledge from multi-modal contexts and our newly proposed self-supervised learn- ing process are effective for TQA problems.",

Existing work is limited to locating information within a single page and does not facilitate cross-page question-and-answer interaction. Furthermore, the token length limitation imposed on inputs to the model may lead to truncation of segments pertinent to the answer. In this study, we introduce a simple but effective methodology called CFRet-DVQA, which focuses on retrieval and efficient tuning to address this critical issue effectively. For that, we initially retrieve multiple segments from the document that correlate with the question at hand. Subsequently, we leverage the advanced reasoning abilities of the large language model (LLM), further augmenting its performance through instruction tuning. This approach enables the generation of answers that align with the style of the document labels.

An appropriate dataset is critical for the research of PGDP. Although some datasets with rough annotations have been proposed to solve geometric problems, they are either small in scale or not publicly available. The rough annotations also make them not very useful. Thus, we propose a new large-scale geometry diagram dataset named PGDP5K and a novel annotation method.

        "abstract": "Mathematical reasoning, a core ability of human intelligence, presents unique challenges for machines in abstract thinking and logical reasoning. Recent large pre-trained language models such as GPT-3 have achieved remarkable progress on mathematical reasoning tasks written in text form, such as math word problems (MWP). However, it is unknown if the models can handle more complex prob- lems that involve math reasoning over heterogeneous information, such as tabular data. To fill the gap, we present Tabular Math Word Problems (TABMWP), a new dataset containing 38,431 open-domain grade-level problems that require mathe- matical reasoning on both textual and tabular data. Each question in TABMWP is aligned with a tabular context, which is presented as an image, semi-structured text, and a structured table. There are two types of questions: free-text and multi- choice, and each problem is annotated with gold solutions to reveal the multi-step reasoning process. We evaluate different pre-trained models on TABMWP, in- cluding the GPT-3 model in a few-shot setting. As earlier studies suggest, since few-shot GPT-3 relies on the selection of in-context examples, its performance is unstable and can degrade to near chance. The unstable issue is more severe when handling complex problems like TABMWP. To mitigate this, we further propose a novel approach, PROMPTPG, which utilizes policy gradient to learn to select in-context examples from a small amount of training data and then constructs the corresponding prompt for the test example. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the best baseline by 5.31% on the accuracy metric and re- duces the prediction variance significantly compared to random selection, which verifies its effectiveness in selecting in-context examples.1",

However, the application of autonomy in endoscopic surgery is very challenging, particularly in soft tissue work, due to the lack of high-quality images and the unpredictable, constantly deforming environment. In this work, we propose a novel surgical perception framework, SuPer, for surgical robotic control. This framework continuously collects 3D geometric information that allows for mapping a deformable surgical field while tracking rigid instruments within the field. To achieve this, a model-based tracker is employed to localize the surgical tool with a kinematic prior in conjunction with a model-free tracker to reconstruct the deformable environment and provide an estimated point cloud as a mapping of the environment. The proposed framework was implemented on the da Vinci Surgical\u20ddR System in real-time with an end-effector controller where the target configurations are set and regulated through the framework. Our proposed framework successfully completed soft tissue manipulation tasks with high accuracy. The demonstration of this novel framework is promising for the future of surgical autonomy.

However, current assessments mainly focus on recognizing and reasoning abilities, lacking direct evaluation of conversational skills and neglecting visual storytelling abilities. In this paper, we propose an evaluation method that uses strong LLMs as judges to comprehensively evaluate the various abilities of LVLMs. Firstly, we construct a comprehensive visual dialogue dataset TouchStone, consisting of open-world images and questions, covering five major categories of abilities and 27 subtasks. This dataset not only covers funda- mental recognition and comprehension but also extends to literary creation. Secondly, by integrating detailed image annotations we effectively transform the multimodal in- put content into a form understandable by LLMs. This enables us to employ advanced LLMs for directly evaluating the quality of the multimodal dialogue without requiring human intervention. Through validation, we demonstrate that powerful LVLMs, such as GPT-4, can effectively score dialogue quality by leveraging their textual capabilities alone, aligning with human preferences. We hope our work can serve as a touchstone for LVLMs\u2019 evaluation and pave the way for building stronger LVLMs. The evaluation code is available at https://github.com/OFA-Sys/TouchStone.",

        "abstract": "\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) generalize well across language tasks, but suffer from hallucinations and uninterpretability, making it difficult to assess their accu- racy without ground-truth. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) models have been proposed to reduce hallucinations and provide provenance for how an an- swer was generated. Applying such models to the scientific literature may enable large-scale, systematic processing of scientific knowledge. We present PaperQA, a RAG agent for answering questions over the scientific literature. PaperQA is an agent that performs information retrieval across full-text scientific articles, as- sesses the relevance of sources and passages, and uses RAG to provide answers. Viewing this agent as a question-answering model, we find it exceeds performance of existing LLMs and LLM agents on current science QA benchmarks. To push the field closer to how humans perform research on scientific literature, we also introduce LitQA, a more complex benchmark that requires retrieval and synthesis of information from full-text scientific papers across the literature. Finally, we demonstrate PaperQA\u2019s matches expert human researchers on LitQA.",

        "abstract": "Finetuning language models on a collection of datasets phrased as instructions has been shown to improve model performance and generalization to unseen tasks. In this paper we explore instruction finetuning with a particular focus on (1) scaling the number of tasks, (2) scaling the model size, and (3) finetuning on chain-of-thought data. We find that instruction finetuning with the above aspects dramatically improves performance on a variety of model classes (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM), prompting setups (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT), and evaluation benchmarks (MMLU, BBH, TyDiQA, MGSM, open-ended generation, RealToxicityPrompts). For instance, Flan-PaLM 540B instruction-finetuned on 1.8K tasks outperforms PaLM 540B by a large margin (+9.4% on average). Flan-PaLM 540B achieves state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks, such as 75.2% on five-shot MMLU. We also publicly release Flan-T5 checkpoints,1 which achieve strong few-shot performance even compared to much larger models, such as PaLM 62B. Overall, instruction finetuning is a general method for improving the performance and usability of pretrained language models.",

Recent studies on KVQA inject an external knowledge in a multi-modal form, and as more knowledge is used, irrelevant information may be added and can confuse the question answering. In order to properly use the knowledge, this study proposes the following: 1) we introduce a novel semantic inconsistency measure computed from caption uncertainty and semantic similarity; 2) we suggest a new external knowledge assimilation method based on the semantic inconsistency measure and apply it to integrate explicit knowledge and implicit knowledge for KVQA; 3) the proposed method is evaluated with the OK-VQA dataset and achieves the state-of-the-art performance.",

        "abstract": "We present Multiple-Question Multiple- Answer (MQMA), a novel approach to do text-VQA in encoder-decoder transformer models. The text-VQA task requires a model to answer a question by understanding multi-modal content: text (typically from OCR) and an associated image. To the best of our knowledge, almost all previous approaches for text-VQA process a single question and its associated content to predict a single answer. In order to answer multiple questions from the same image, each question and content are fed into the model multiple times. In contrast, our proposed MQMA approach takes multiple questions and content as input at the encoder and predicts multiple answers at the decoder in an auto-regressive manner at the same time. We make several novel architectural modifica- tions to standard encoder-decoder transformers to support MQMA. We also propose a novel MQMA denoising pre-training task which is designed to teach the model to align and delineate multiple questions and content with associated answers. MQMA pre-trained model achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple text-VQA datasets, each with strong baselines. Specifically, on OCR-VQA (+2.5%), TextVQA (+1.4%), ST-VQA (+0.6%), DocVQA (+1.1%) absolute improvements over the previous state-of-the-art approaches.\n",

Furthermore, we introduce a novel approach, called Vision- Reader, which achieved 0.4116 in EM and 0.6990 in the F1-score on the test set. Through the results, we found that the OCR system plays a very important role in VQA models on the ViOCRVQA dataset.

        "abstract": "We propose a novel multimodal architecture for Scene Text Visual Question Answering (STVQA), named Layout- Aware Transformer (LaTr). The task of STVQA requires models to reason over different modalities. Thus, we first investigate the impact of each modality, and reveal the im- portance of the language module, especially when enriched with layout information. Accounting for this, we propose a single objective pre-training scheme that requires only text and spatial cues. We show that applying this pre-training scheme on scanned documents has certain advantages over using natural images, despite the domain gap. Scanned documents are easy to procure, text-dense and have a vari- ety of layouts, helping the model learn various spatial cues (e.g. left-of, below etc.) by tying together language and layout information. Compared to existing approaches, our method performs vocabulary-free decoding and, as shown, generalizes well beyond the training vocabulary. We further demonstrate that LaTr improves robustness towards OCR errors, a common reason for failure cases in STVQA. In addition, by leveraging a vision transformer, we eliminate the need for an external object detector. LaTr outperforms state-of-the-art STVQA methods on multiple datasets. In particular, +7.6% on TextVQA, +10.8% on ST-VQA and +4.0% on OCR-VQA (all absolute accuracy numbers).",

Document Visual Question Answer- ing (Document VQA), due to this multi-modal nature, has garnered significant interest from both the document understanding and natural language processing communities. The state-of-the-art single-page Document VQA methods show im- pressive performance, yet in multi-page scenarios, these methods struggle. They have to concatenate all pages into one large page for processing, demanding sub- stantial GPU resources, even for evaluation. In this work, we propose a novel method and efficient training strategy for multi-page Document VQA tasks. In particular, we employ a visual-only document representation, leveraging the en- coder from a document understanding model, Pix2Struct. Our approach utilizes a self-attention scoring mechanism to generate relevance scores for each docu- ment page, enabling the retrieval of pertinent pages. This adaptation allows us to extend single-page Document VQA models to multi-page scenarios without constraints on the number of pages during evaluation, all with minimal demand for GPU resources. Our extensive experiments demonstrate not only achieving state-of-the-art performance without the need for Optical Character Recognition (OCR), but also sustained performance in scenarios extending to documents of nearly 800 pages compared to a maximum of 20 pages in the MP-DocVQA dataset.

It requires a large amount of scene-text relationship understanding compared to the VQA task. Recent studies have shown that the question- answer pairs in the dataset are more focused on the text present in the image but less importance is given to visual features and some questions do not require understanding the image. The models trained on this dataset predict bi- ased answers due to the lack of understanding of visual con- text. For example, in questions like \u201cWhat is written on the signboard?\u201d, the answer predicted by the model is always \u201cSTOP\u201d which makes the model to ignore the image. To address these issues, we propose a method to learn visual features (making V matter in TextVQA) along with the OCR features and question features using VQA dataset as exter- nal knowledge for Text-based VQA. Specifically, we com- bine the TextVQA dataset and VQA dataset and train the model on this combined dataset. Such a simple, yet effec- tive approach increases the understanding and correlation between the image features and text present in the image, which helps in the better answering of questions.

VDU is challenging as it needs a model to make sense of multiple modalities (visual, language and spatial) to make a prediction. Our approach, termed DocFormerv2 is an encoder-decoder transformer which takes as input - vision, language and spatial fea- tures. DocFormerv2 is pre-trained with unsupervised tasks employed asymmetrically i.e., two novel document tasks on encoder and one on the auto-regressive decoder. The un- supervised tasks have been carefully designed to ensure that the pre-training encourages local-feature alignment between multiple modalities. DocFormerv2 when evalu- ated on nine datasets shows state-of-the-art performance over strong baselines e.g. TabFact (4.3%), InfoVQA (1.4%), FUNSD (1%). Furthermore, to show generalization ca- pabilities, on three VQA tasks involving scene-text, Doc- Formerv2 outperforms previous comparably-sized models and even does better than much larger models (such as GIT2, PaLi and Flamingo) on some tasks.

        "abstract": "The problem of verifying whether a textual hypothesis holds based on the given evidence, also known as fact verification, plays an important role in the study of natural language understanding and semantic representation. However, existing studies are mainly restricted to dealing with unstructured evidence (e.g., natu- ral language sentences and documents, news, etc), while verification under struc- tured evidence, such as tables, graphs, and databases, remains under-explored. This paper specifically aims to study the fact verification given semi-structured data as evidence. To this end, we construct a large-scale dataset called TabFact with 16k Wikipedia tables as the evidence for 118k human-annotated natural lan- guage statements, which are labeled as either ENTAILED or REFUTED. TabFact is challenging since it involves both soft linguistic reasoning and hard symbolic reasoning. To address these reasoning challenges, we design two different mod- els: Table-BERT and Latent Program Algorithm (LPA). Table-BERT leverages the state-of-the-art pre-trained language model to encode the linearized tables and statements into continuous vectors for verification. LPA parses statements into programs and executes them against the tables to obtain the returned binary value for verification. Both methods achieve similar accuracy but still lag far be- hind human performance. We also perform a comprehensive analysis to demon- strate great future opportunities.

Such transformers are frequently pre- trained on open-domain content such as Wikipedia, where they effectively encode questions and corresponding tables from Wikipedia as seen in Table QA dataset. However, web tables in Wikipedia are notably flat in their layout, with the first row as the sole column header. The layout lends to a relational view of tables where each row is a tuple. Whereas, tables in domain-specific business or scientific documents often have a much more complex layout, including hierarchical row and column headers, in addition to having specialized vocabulary terms from that domain.\nTo address this problem, we introduce the domain-specific Table QA dataset AIT- QA (Airline Industry Table QA). The dataset consists of 515 questions authored by human annotators on 116 tables extracted from public U.S. SEC filings1 of major airline companies for the fiscal years 2017-2019.

        "abstract": "We present a new multimodal question answering challenge, MANYMODALQA, in which an agent must answer a ques- tion by considering three distinct modalities: text, images, and tables. We collect our data by scraping Wikipedia and then utilize crowdsourcing to collect question-answer pairs. Our questions are ambiguous, in that the modality that con- tains the answer is not easily determined based solely upon the question. To demonstrate this ambiguity, we construct a modality selector (or disambiguator) network, and this model gets substantially lower accuracy on our challenge set, com- pared to existing datasets, indicating that our questions are more ambiguous. By analyzing this model, we investigate which words in the question are indicative of the modal- ity. Next, we construct a simple baseline MANYMODALQA model, which, based on the prediction from the modality se- lector, fires a corresponding pre-trained state-of-the-art uni- modal QA model. We focus on providing the community with a new manymodal evaluation set and only provide a fine-tuning set, with the expectation that existing datasets and approaches will be transferred for most of the training, to encourage low-resource generalization without large, mono- lithic training sets for each new task. There is a significant gap between our baseline models and human performance; therefore, we hope that this challenge encourages research in end-to-end modality disambiguation and multimodal QA models, as well as transfer learning.",

        "abstract": "Table understanding capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has been ex- tensively studied through the task of question-answering (QA) over tables. Typ- ically, only a small part of the whole table is relevant to derive the answer for a given question. The irrelevant parts act as noise and are distracting information, resulting in sub-optimal performance due to the vulnerability of LLMs to noise. To mitigate this, we propose CABINET (Content RelevAnce-Based NoIse Re- ductioN for TablE QuesTion-Answering) \u2013 a framework to enable LLMs to focus on relevant tabular data by suppressing extraneous information. CABINET com- prises an Unsupervised Relevance Scorer (URS), trained differentially with the QA LLM, that weighs the table content based on its relevance to the input ques- tion before feeding it to the question-answering LLM (QA LLM). To further aid the relevance scorer, CABINET employs a weakly supervised module that gen- erates a parsing statement describing the criteria of rows and columns relevant to the question and highlights the content of corresponding table cells. CABINET significantly outperforms various tabular LLM baselines, as well as GPT3-based in-context learning methods, is more robust to noise, maintains outperformance on tables of varying sizes, and establishes new SoTA performance on WikiTQ, FeTaQA, and WikiSQL datasets. We release our code and datasets here.",

Compared with existing visual question answering (VQA) datasets that contain texts in images, VisualMRC focuses more on developing natural language understanding and generation abilities. It contains 30,000+ pairs of a question and an abstractive answer for 10,000+ document images sourced from multiple domains of webpages. We also introduce a new model that extends existing sequence-to-sequence models, pre-trained with largescale text corpora, to take into account the visual layout and content of documents. Experiments with VisualMRC show that this model outperformed the base sequence-to-sequence models and a state-of-the-art VQA model. However, its performance is still below that of humans on most automatic evaluation metrics. The dataset will facilitate research aimed at connecting vision and language understanding.",

The series comprises: 1) ShareGPT4Video, 40K GPT4V annotated dense captions of videos with various lengths and sources, developed through carefully designed data filtering and an- notating strategy. 2) ShareCaptioner-Video, an efficient and capable captioning model for arbitrary videos, with 4.8M high-quality aesthetic videos annotated by it. 3) ShareGPT4Video-8B, a simple yet superb LVLM that reached SOTA per- formance on three advancing video benchmarks. To achieve this, taking aside the non-scalable costly human annotators, we find using GPT4V to caption video with a naive multi-frame or frame-concatenation input strategy leads to less detailed and sometimes temporal-confused results. We argue the challenge of designing a high-quality video captioning strategy lies in three aspects: 1) Inter-frame precise temporal change understanding. 2) Intra-frame detailed content description. 3)Frame-numberscalabilityforarbitrary-lengthvideos. Tothisend,wemetic- ulously designed a differential video captioning strategy, which is stable, scalable, and efficient for generating captions for videos with arbitrary resolution, aspect ratios, and length. Based on it, we construct ShareGPT4Video, which contains 40K high-quality videos spanning a wide range of categories, and the resulting captions encompass rich world knowledge, object attributes, camera movements, and crucially, detailed and precise temporal descriptions of events. Based on ShareGPT4Video, we further develop ShareCaptioner-Video, a superior captioner capable of efficiently generating high-quality captions for arbitrary videos. We annotated 4.8M aesthetically appealing videos by it and verified their effectiveness on a 10-second text2video generation task. For video understanding, we verified the effectiveness of ShareGPT4Video on several current LVLM architectures and presented our superb new LVLM ShareGPT4Video-8B. All the models, strategies, and annotations2 will be open-sourced and we hope this project can serve as a pivotal resource for advancing both the LVLMs and T2VMs community.",

The AVA dataset densely annotates 80 atomic visual actions in 430 15-minute video clips, where actions are localized in space and time, resulting in 1.58M action labels with multiple labels per person occurring frequently. The key charac- teristics of our dataset are: (1) the definition of atomic visual actions, rather than composite actions; (2) precise spatio-temporal annotations with possibly multiple annota- tions for each person; (3) exhaustive annotation of these atomic actions over 15-minute video clips; (4) people tem- porally linked across consecutive segments; and (5) using movies to gather a varied set of action representations. This departs from existing datasets for spatio-temporal action recognition, which typically provide sparse annotations for composite actions in short video clips.\nAVA, with its realistic scene and action complexity, ex- poses the intrinsic difficulty of action recognition. To bench- mark this, we present a novel approach for action local- ization that builds upon the current state-of-the-art meth- ods, and demonstrates better performance on JHMDB and UCF101-24 categories. While setting a new state of the art on existing datasets, the overall results on AVA are low at 15.6% mAP, underscoring the need for developing new ap- proaches for video understanding.",

Open-source software packages for Machine Learn- ing and inexpensive commodity hardware have reduced the bar- rier of entry for exploring novel approaches at scale. It is possible to train models over millions of examples within a few days. Al- though large-scale datasets exist for image understanding, such as ImageNet, there are no comparable size video classification datasets.\nIn this paper, we introduce YouTube-8M, the largest multi-label video classification dataset, composed of \u223c8 million videos\u2014500K hours of video\u2014annotated with a vocabulary of 4800 visual en- tities. To get the videos and their (multiple) labels, we used a YouTube video annotation system, which labels videos with the main topics in them. While the labels are machine-generated, they have high-precision and are derived from a variety of human-based signals including metadata and query click signals, so they repre- sent an excellent target for content-based annotation approaches. We filtered the video labels (Knowledge Graph entities) using both automated and manual curation strategies, including asking human raters if the labels are visually recognizable. Then, we decoded each video at one-frame-per-second, and used a Deep CNN pre- trained on ImageNet to extract the hidden representation immedi- ately prior to the classification layer. Finally, we compressed the frame features and make both the features and video-level labels available for download. The dataset contains frame-level features for over 1.9 billion video frames and 8 million videos, making it the largest public multi-label video dataset.\nWe trained various (modest) classification models on the dataset, evaluated them using popular evaluation metrics, and report them as baselines. Despite the size of the dataset, some of our models train to convergence in less than a day on a single machine using the publicly-available TensorFlow framework. We plan to release code for training a basic TensorFlow model and for computing metrics.\nWe show that pre-training on large data generalizes to other datasets like Sports-1M and ActivityNet. We achieve state-of-the-art on Ac- tivityNet, improving mAP from 53.8% to 77.6%. We hope that the unprecedented scale and diversity of YouTube-8M will lead to ad- vances in video understanding and representation learning.",

The existing depth-based and RGB+D-based action recognition benchmarks have a number of limitations, including the lack of large-scale training samples, realistic number of distinct class categories, diversity in camera views, varied environmental conditions, and variety of human subjects. In this work, we introduce a large-scale dataset for RGB+D human action recognition, which is collected from 106 distinct subjects and contains more than 114 thousand video samples and 8 million frames. This dataset contains 120 different action classes including daily, mutual, and health-related activities.

Different from widely-studied vision-language pretraining models, VALOR jointly models relationships of vision, audio and language in an end-to-end manner. It contains three separate encoders for single modality representations, and a decoder for multimodal conditional text generation. We design two pretext tasks to pretrain VALOR model, including Multimodal Grouping Alignment (MGA) and Multimodal Grouping Captioning (MGC). MGA projects vision, language and audio to the same common space, building vision-language, audio-language and audiovisual-language alignment simultaneously. MGC learns how to generate text tokens in conditions of vision, audio or their both. To promote vision-audio-language pretraining research, we construct a large-scale high-quality tri-modality dataset named VALOR-1M, which contains 1M audiable videos with human annotated audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments show that VALOR can learn strong multimodal correlations and be generalized to various downstream tasks (e.g., retrieval, captioning and question answering), with different input modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language and audiovisual-language).

However, this integration has also exposed LLMs to the risk of indirect prompt injection attacks, where an attacker can embed malicious instructions within external content, compromising LLM output and causing responses to deviate from user expectations. To investigate this important but underexplored issue, we introduce the first benchmark for indirect prompt injection attacks, named BIPIA, to evaluate the risk of such attacks. Based on the evaluation, our work makes a key analysis of the underlying reason for the success of the attack, namely the inability of LLMs to distinguish between instructions and external content and the absence of LLMs\u2019 awareness to not execute instructions within external content. Building upon this analysis, we develop two black-box methods based on prompt learning and a white-box defense method based on fine-tuning with adversarial training accordingly. Experimental results demonstrate that black-box defenses are highly effective in mitigating these attacks, while the white-box defense reduces the attack success rate to near-zero levels. Overall, our work systematically investigates indirect prompt injection attacks by introducing a benchmark, analyzing the underlying reason for the success of the attack, and developing an initial set of defenses",

        "abstract": "Enabling a computer to understand a docu- ment so that it can answer comprehension questions is a central, yet unsolved goal of NLP. A key factor impeding its solu- tion by machine learned systems is the lim- ited availability of human-annotated data. Hermann et al. (2015) seek to solve this problem by creating over a million training examples by pairing CNN and Daily Mail news articles with their summarized bullet points, and show that a neural network can then be trained to give good performance on this task. In this paper, we conduct a thorough examination of this new reading comprehension task. Our primary aim is to understand what depth of language under- standing is required to do well on this task. We approach this from one side by doing a careful hand-analysis of a small subset of the problems and from the other by show- ing that simple, carefully designed systems can obtain accuracies of 73.6% and 76.6% on these two datasets, exceeding current state-of-the-art results by 7\u201310% and ap- proaching what we believe is the ceiling for performance on this task.",

However, the summarization of diverse infor- mation dispersed across multiple articles about an event remains underexplored. In this pa- per, we propose a new task of summarizing diverse information encountered in multiple news articles encompassing the same event. To facilitate this task, we present a data collection schema for identifying diverse information and curated a dataset named DIVERSESUMM. The dataset includes 245 news stories, with each story comprising 10 news articles and paired with a human-validated reference. Next, to enable consistent automatic evaluation, we con- duct a comprehensive analysis to pinpoint the position and verbosity biases when utilizing Large Language Model (LLM)-based metrics for evaluating the coverage and faithfulness of summaries. Through correlation analyses, we outline the best practices for effectively using automatic LLM-based metrics on the DIVERS- ESUMM dataset. Finally, we study how LLMs summarize multiple news articles by analyz- ing which type of diverse information LLMs are capable of identifying. Our analyses sug- gest that despite the extraordinary capabilities of LLMs in single-document summarization, the proposed task remains a complex challenge for them mainly due to their limited coverage, with GPT-4 only able to cover under 40% of the diverse information on average.1",

        "abstract": "Managing long sequences has become an important and necessary feature for large language models (LLMs). However, it is still an open question of how to com- prehensively and systematically evaluate the long-sequence capability of LLMs. One of the reasons is that conventional and widely-used benchmarks mainly con- sist of short sequences. In this paper, we propose M4LE, a Multi-ability, Multi- range, Multi-task, Multi-domain benchmark for Long-context Evaluation. M4LE is based on a diverse NLP task pool comprising 36 NLP datasets, 11 task types and 12 domains. To alleviate the scarcity of tasks with naturally long sequences and incorporate multiple-ability assessment, we propose an automatic approach (but with negligible human annotations) to convert short-sequence tasks into a unified long-sequence scenario where LLMs have to identify single or multiple relevant spans in long contexts based on explicit or semantic hints. Specifically, the scenario includes five different types of abilities: (1) explicit single-span; (2) semantic single-span; (3) explicit multiple-span; (4) semantic multiple-span; and (5) global context understanding. The resulting samples in M4LE are evenly dis- tributed from 1k to 8k input length.1 We conducted a systematic evaluation on 11 well-established LLMs, especially those optimized for long-sequence inputs. Our results reveal that: 1) Current LLMs struggle to understand long context, particu- larly when tasks require multiple-span attention. 2) Semantic retrieval task is more difficult for competent LLMs. 3) Models fine-tuned on longer text with position interpolation have comparable performance to those using Neural Tangent Ker- nel (NTK) aware scaling methods without fine-tuning.

While proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Claude can largely preserve the reasoning ability in an extended context, open-source models are still progressing through the early stages of de- velopment. To bridge this gap, we propose L-Eval to institute a more standardized evaluation for long context language models (LCLMs) addressing two key as- pects: dataset construction and evaluation metrics. On the one hand, we build a new evaluation suite containing 20 sub-tasks, 508 long documents, and over 2,000 human-labeled query-response pairs encompassing diverse question styles, domains, and input length (3k\u223c200k tokens). On the other hand, we investigate the effectiveness in evalution metrics for LCLMs. Results show that popular n- gram matching metrics generally can not correlate well with human judgment, and thus we strongly advocate for length-instruction-enhanced (LIE) evaluation and employing LLM judges. We conducted a comprehensive study of 4 popular commercial LLMs and 12 open-source counterparts using the L-Eval benchmark. Our empirical findings offer useful insights into the study of LCLMs and lay the groundwork for the development of more principled evaluation of these models.1",

Through a survey of 162 papers on long-form summarization, we first shed light on current human evaluation practices surrounding long-form summaries. We find that 73% of these papers do not perform any human evaluation on model-generated sum- maries, while other works face new difficul- ties that manifest when dealing with long documents (e.g., low inter-annotator agree- ment). Motivated by our survey, we present LONGEVAL, a set of guidelines for human evaluation of faithfulness in long-form sum- maries that addresses the following challenges: (1) How can we achieve high inter-annotator agreement on faithfulness scores? (2) How can we minimize annotator workload while maintaining accurate faithfulness scores? and (3) Do humans benefit from automated align- ment between summary and source snippets? We deploy LONGEVAL in annotation studies on two long-form summarization datasets in different domains (SQuALITY and PubMed), and we find that switching to a finer granu- larity of judgment (e.g., clause-level) reduces inter-annotator variance in faithfulness scores (e.g., std-dev from 18.5 to 6.8). We also show that scores from a partial annotation of fine-grained units highly correlates with scores from a full annotation workload (0.89 Kendall\u2019s \u03c4 using 50% judgments).

        "abstract": "Synthesizing SQL queries from natural language is a long-standing open problem and has been attracting considerable interest recently. Toward solving the prob- lem, the de facto approach is to employ a sequence-to-sequence-style model. Such an approach will necessarily require the SQL queries to be serialized. Since the same SQL query may have multiple equivalent serializations, training a sequence- to-sequence-style model is sensitive to the choice from one of them. This phe- nomenon is documented as the \u201corder-matters\u201d problem. Existing state-of-the-art approaches rely on reinforcement learning to reward the decoder when it generates any of the equivalent serializations. However, we observe that the improvement from reinforcement learning is limited.\nIn this paper, we propose a novel approach, i.e., SQLNet, to fundamentally solve this problem by avoiding the sequence-to-sequence structure when the order does not matter. In particular, we employ a sketch-based approach where the sketch contains a dependency graph so that one prediction can be done by taking into consideration only the previous predictions that it depends on. In addition, we propose a sequence-to-set model as well as the column attention mechanism to synthesize the query based on the sketch. By combining all these novel tech- niques, we show that SQLNet can outperform the prior art by 9% to 13% on the WikiSQL task.",

In this pa- per, we present TAPAS, an approach to ques- tion answering over tables without generating logical forms.

In TableQuery, we use deep learning models pre-trained for question answering on free text to convert natural language queries to structured queries, which can be run against a database or a spreadsheet. This method eliminates the need for fitting the entire data into memory as well as serializing databases. Furthermore, deep learning models pre-trained for question answering on free text are readily available on platforms such as HuggingFace Model Hub (7). TableQuery does not require re-training; when a newly trained model for question answering with better performance is available, it can replace the existing model in TableQuery.",

        "abstract": "Table Question Answering (TQA) aims at com- posing an answer to a question based on tabu- lar data. While prior research has shown that TQA models lack robustness, understanding the underlying cause and nature of this issue remains predominantly unclear, posing a sig- nificant obstacle to the development of robust TQA systems. In this paper, we formalize three major desiderata for a fine-grained evaluation of robustness of TQA systems. They should (i) answer questions regardless of alterations in table structure, (ii) base their responses on the content of relevant cells rather than on biases, and (iii) demonstrate robust numerical reason- ing capabilities. To investigate these aspects, we create and publish a novel TQA evaluation benchmark in English. Our extensive experi- mental analysis reveals that none of the exam- ined state-of-the-art TQA systems consistently excelsinthesethreeaspects. Ourbenchmark is a crucial instrument for monitoring the be- havior of TQA systems and paves the way for the development of robust TQA systems. We release our benchmark publicly.",

        "abstract": "Answering real-world complex queries, such as complex product search, often requires accurate retrieval from semi-structured knowledge bases that involve blend of unstructured (e.g., textual descriptions of products) and structured (e.g., entity relations of products) information. However, previous works have mostly studied textual and relational retrieval tasks as separate topics. To address the gap, we develop STARK, a large-scale Semi-structure retrieval benchmark on Textual and Relational Knowledge Bases. Our benchmark covers three domains/datasets: product search, academic paper search, and queries in precision medicine. We design a novel pipeline to synthesize realistic user queries that integrate diverse relational information and complex textual properties, together with their ground- truth answers (items). We conduct rigorous human evaluation to validate the quality of our synthesized queries. We further enhance the benchmark with high-quality human-generated queries to provide an authentic reference. STARK serves as a comprehensive testbed for evaluating the performance of retrieval systems driven by large language models (LLMs). Our experiments suggest that STARK presents significant challenges to the current retrieval and LLM systems, indicating the demand for building more capable retrieval systems.

The utterances were collected from 222 hospital staff members, including physicians, nurses, and insurance review and health records teams. To construct the QA dataset on structured EHR data, we conducted a poll at a university hospital and used the responses to create seed questions. We then manually linked these questions to two open-source EHR databases, MIMIC-III and eICU, and included various time expressions and held-out unanswerable questions in the dataset, which were also collected from the poll. Our dataset poses a unique set of challenges: the model needs to 1) generate SQL queries that reflect a wide range of needs in the hospital, including simple retrieval and complex operations such as calculating survival rate, 2) understand various time expressions to answer time-sensitive questions in healthcare, and 3) distinguish whether a given question is answerable or unanswerable. We believe our dataset, EHRSQL, can serve as a practical benchmark for developing and assessing QA models on structured EHR data and take a step further towards bridging the gap between text-to-SQL research and its real-life deployment in healthcare.

        "abstract": "Electronic medical records (EMR) contain comprehensive patient information and are typically stored in a relational database with multiple tables. Effective and efficient patient information retrieval from EMR data is a challenging task for medical experts. Question- to-SQL generation methods tackle this problem by first predicting the SQL query for a given question about a database, and then, executing the query on the database. However, most of the existing approaches have not been adapted to the healthcare domain due to a lack of healthcare Question-to-SQL dataset for learning models specific to this domain. In addition, wide use of the abbreviation of terminologies and possible typos in questions introduce additional challenges for accurately generating the corresponding SQL queries. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by developing a deep learn- ing based TRanslate-Edit Model for Question-to-SQL (TREQS) gen- eration, which adapts the widely used sequence-to-sequence model to directly generate the SQL query for a given question, and further performs the required edits using an attentive-copying mechanism and task-specific look-up tables. Based on the widely used publicly available electronic medical database, we create a new large-scale Question-SQL pair dataset, named MIMICSQL, in order to perform the Question-to-SQL generation task in healthcare domain. An extensive set of experiments are conducted to evaluate the perfor- mance of our proposed model on MIMICSQL. Both quantitative and qualitative experimental results indicate the flexibility and effi- ciency of our proposed method in predicting condition values and its robustness to random questions with abbreviations and typos.",

On Spider, a challenging text- to-SQL benchmark that contains complex and nested SQL queries, we demonstrate that Nat- SQL outperforms other IRs, and significantly improves the performance of several previous SOTA models.

Such transformers are frequently pre- trained on open-domain content such as Wikipedia, where they effectively encode questions and corresponding tables from Wikipedia as seen in Table QA dataset. However, web tables in Wikipedia are notably flat in their layout, with the first row as the sole column header. The layout lends to a relational view of tables where each row is a tuple. Whereas, tables in domain-specific business or scientific documents often have a much more complex layout, including hierarchical row and column headers, in addition to having specialized vocabulary terms from that domain.\nTo address this problem, we introduce the domain-specific Table QA dataset AIT- QA (Airline Industry Table QA). The dataset consists of 515 questions authored by human annotators on 116 tables extracted from public U.S. SEC filings1 of major airline companies for the fiscal years 2017-2019. We also provide annotations pertaining to the nature of questions, marking those that require hierarchical head- ers, domain-specific terminology, and paraphrased forms. Our zero-shot baseline evaluation of three transformer-based SOTA Table QA methods - TaPAS (end-to- end), TaBERT (semantic parsing-based), and RCI (row-column encoding-based) - clearly exposes the limitation of these methods in this practical setting, with the best accuracy at just 51.8% (RCI).

We collect target summaries from more than seven thousand survey papers and utilize their 430 thousand reference papers\u2019 abstracts as input docu- ments. To organize the diverse content from dozens of input documents and ensure the efficiency of pro- cessing long text sequences, we propose a summa- rization method named category-based alignment and sparse transformer (CAST). The experimental results show that our CAST method outperforms various advanced summarization methods.",

Consequently, recent work on applying text mining tech- nologies for scholarly publications has investigated the application of automatic text summarization technologies, including extreme summarization, for this domain. However, previous work has con- centrated only on monolingual settings, primarily in English. In this paper, we fill this research gap and present an abstractive cross-lingual summarization dataset for four different languages in the scholarly domain, which enables us to train and evaluate models that process English papers and generate summaries in German, Italian, Chinese and Japanese.

To amortize reading time, we collect five summaries per document, with the first giving an overview and the subsequent four addressing specific questions.

A system producing a single generic summary cannot concisely satisfy both aspects. Our fo- cus in evaluation is how well existing tech- niques can generalize to these domains with- out seeing in-domain training data, so we turn to techniques to construct synthetic training data that have been used in query-focused sum- marization work. We compare several train- ing schemes that differ in how strongly key- words are used and how oracle summaries are extracted.

While proprietary models such as GPT-4 and Claude can largely preserve the reasoning ability in an extended context, open-source models are still progressing through the early stages of de- velopment. To bridge this gap, we propose L-Eval to institute a more standardized evaluation for long context language models (LCLMs) addressing two key as- pects: dataset construction and evaluation metrics. On the one hand, we build a new evaluation suite containing 20 sub-tasks, 508 long documents, and over 2,000 human-labeled query-response pairs encompassing diverse question styles, domains, and input length (3k\u223c200k tokens). On the other hand, we investigate the effectiveness in evalution metrics for LCLMs. Results show that popular n- gram matching metrics generally can not correlate well with human judgment, and thus we strongly advocate for length-instruction-enhanced (LIE) evaluation and employing LLM judges. We conducted a comprehensive study of 4 popular commercial LLMs and 12 open-source counterparts using the L-Eval benchmark. Our empirical findings offer useful insights into the study of LCLMs and lay the groundwork for the development of more principled evaluation of these models.1",

To raise the concerns of reading curve text in the wild, in this paper, we\nconstruct a curve text dataset named CTW1500, which includes over 10k text annotations in 1,500 images (1000\nfor training and 500 for testing). Based on this dataset,\nwe pioneering propose a polygon based curve text detector (CTD) which can directly detect curve text without empirical combination. Moreover, by seamlessly integrating\nthe recurrent transverse and longitudinal offset connection\n(TLOC), the proposed method can be end-to-end trainable\nto learn the inherent connection among the position offsets. This allows the CTD to explore context information instead of predicting points independently, resulting in\nmore smooth and accurate detection. We also propose two\nsimple but effective post-processing methods named nonpolygon suppress (NPS) and polygonal non-maximum suppression (PNMS) to further improve the detection accuracy.\nFurthermore, the proposed approach in this paper is designed in an universal manner, which can also be trained\nwith rectangular or quadrilateral bounding boxes without\nextra efforts. Experimental results on CTW-1500 demonstrate our method with only a light backbone can outperform state-of-the-art methods with a large margin. By evaluating only in the curve or non-curve subset, the CTD +\nTLOC can still achieve the best results. Code is available\nat https://github.com/Yuliang-Liu/Curve-Text-Detector.",

We introduce Automatic Reasoning and Tool-use\n(ART), a framework that uses frozen LLMs\nto automatically generate intermediate reasoning steps as a program. Given a new task to\nsolve, ART selects demonstrations of multistep reasoning and tool use from a task library. At test time, ART seamlessly pauses\ngeneration whenever external tools are called,\nand integrates their output before resuming\ngeneration. ART achieves a substantial improvement over few-shot prompting and automatic CoT on unseen tasks in the BigBench\nand MMLU benchmarks, and matches performance of hand-crafted CoT prompts on a majority of these tasks. ART is also extensible,\nand makes it easy for humans to improve performance by correcting errors in task-specific\nprograms or incorporating new tools, which\nwe demonstrate by drastically improving performance on select tasks with minimal human\nintervention.",

The\naugmentation enables contrast with another view of a single image but enlarges training time and memory usage. To\nexploit the strength of multi-views while avoiding the high\ncomputation cost, we introduce a multi-exit architecture that\noutputs multiple features of a single image in a single-viewed\nframework. To this end, we propose Self-Contrastive (SelfCon) learning, which self-contrasts within multiple outputs\nfrom the different levels of a single network.

We demonstrate that SelfCon learning improves the classification performance of the encoder network, and empirically\nanalyze its advantages in terms of the single-view and the subnetwork. Furthermore, we provide theoretical evidence of the\nperformance increase based on the mutual information bound.\nFor ImageNet classification on ResNet-50, SelfCon improves\naccuracy by +0.6% with 59% memory and 48% time of Supervised Contrastive learning, and a simple ensemble of multi-exit\noutputs boosts performance up to +1.5%.

        "abstract": "Video recognition has been advanced in recent years by benchmarks with rich annotations. However, research is still mainly limited to human action or sports recognition - focusing on a highly specific video understanding task and thus leaving a significant gap towards describing the overall content of a video. We fill this gap by presenting a largescale \u201cHolistic Video Understanding Dataset\u201d (HVU). HVU is organized hierarchically in a semantic taxonomy that focuses on multi-label and multi-task video understanding as a comprehensive problem that encompasses the recognition of multiple semantic aspects in the dynamic scene. HVU contains approx. 572k videos in total with 9 million annotations for training, validation and test set spanning over 3142 labels. HVU encompasses semantic aspects defined on categories of scenes, objects, actions, events, attributes and concepts which naturally captures the real-world scenarios. We demonstrate the generalisation capability of HVU on three challenging tasks: 1.) Video classification, 2.) Video captioning and 3.) Video clustering tasks. In particular for video classification, we introduce a new spatio-temporal deep neural network architecture called \u201cHolistic Appearance and Temporal Network\u201d (HATNet) that builds on fusing 2D and 3D architectures into one by combining intermediate representations of appearance and temporal cues. HATNet focuses on the multi-label and multi-task learning problem and is trained in an end-to-end manner. Via our experiments, we validate the idea that holistic representation learning is complementary, and can play a key role in enabling many real-world applications. https://holistic-video-understanding.github.io/",

By leveraging data from multiple clients, the FL paradigm can be especially beneficial for clients that have little training data to develop a data-hungry neural semantic parser on their own. We propose an evaluation setup to study this task, where we re-purpose widely-used single-domain text-to-SQL datasets as clients to form a realistic heterogeneous FL setting and collaboratively train a global model. As standard FL algorithms suffer from the high client heterogeneity in our realistic setup, we further propose a novel LOss Reduction Adjusted Reweighting (Lorar) mechanism to mitigate the performance degradation, which adjusts each client\u2019s contribution to the global model update based on its training loss reduction during each round. Our intuition is that the larger the loss reduction, the further away the current global model is from the client\u2019s local optimum, and the larger weight the client should get. By applying Lorar to three widely adopted FL algorithms (FedAvg, FedOPT and FedProx), we observe that their performance can be improved substantially on average (4%-20% absolute gain under MacroAvg) and that clients with smaller datasets enjoy larger performance gains. In addition, the global model converges faster for almost all the clients.1",

This synthesize-repair loop is repeated until the algorithm infers a query with a sufficiently high confidence score.

Furthermore, it allows for fine-grained alignment of query tokens to OT operations. In our method, we randomly generate OTs from a context-free grammar. Afterwards, annotators have to write the appropriate natural language question that is represented by the OT. Finally, the annotators assign the tokens to the OT operations. We apply the method to create a new corpus OTTA (Operation Trees and Token Assignment), a large semantic parsing corpus for evaluating natural language interfaces to databases. We compare OTTA to Spider and LC-QuaD 2.0 and show that our methodology more than triples the annotation speed while maintaining the complexity of the queries.

Scaling semantic parsing to arbitrary domains faces two interrelated challenges: obtaining broad coverage training data effectively and cheaply; and developing a model that generalizes to compositional utterances and complex intentions. We address these challenges with a framework which allows to elicit training data from a domain ontology and bootstrap a neural parser which recursively builds derivations of logical forms. In our framework meaning representations are described by sequences of natural language templates, where each template corresponds to a decomposed fragment of the underlying meaning representation. Although artificial, templates can be understood and paraphrased by humans to create natural utterances, resulting in parallel triples of utterances, meaning representations, and their decompositions. These allow us to train a neural semantic parser which learns to compose rules in deriving meaning representations. We crowdsource training data on six domains, covering both single-turn utterances which exhibit rich compositionality, and sequential utterances where a complex task is procedurally performed in steps. We then develop neural semantic parsers which perform such compositional tasks. In general, our approach allows to deploy neural semantic parsers quickly and cheaply from a given domain ontology.",

Local deployment of LLMs on edge devices is necessary when handling privacy-sensitive data or latency-sensitive tasks. The computational constraints of such devices make direct deployment of powerful large-scale LLMs impractical, necessitating the Knowledge Distillation from large-scale models to lightweight models. Lots of work has been done to elicit diversity and quality training examples from LLMs, but little attention has been paid to aligning teacher instructional content based on student preferences, akin to \"responsive teaching\" in pedagogy. Thus, we propose ARTE, dubbed Aligning TeacheR with StudenT PreferencEs, a framework that aligns the teacher model with student preferences to generate tailored training examples for Knowledge Distillation. Specifically, we elicit draft questions and rationales from the teacher model, then collect student preferences on these questions and rationales using students' performance with in-context learning as a proxy, and finally align the teacher model with student preferences. In the end, we repeat the first step with the aligned teacher model to elicit tailored training examples for the student model on the target task. Extensive experiments on academic benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of ARTE over existing instruction-tuning datasets distilled from powerful LLMs. Moreover, we thoroughly investigate the generalization of ARTE, including the generalization of fine-tuned student models in reasoning ability and the generalization of aligned teacher models to generate tailored training data across tasks and students. In summary, our contributions lie in proposing a novel framework for tailored training example generation, demonstrating its efficacy in experiments, and investigating the generalization of both student & aligned teacher models in ARTE.",

        "abstract": "FActScore has gained popularity as a metric to estimate the factuality of long-form texts generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) in English. However, there has not been any work in studying the behavior of FActScore in other languages. This paper studies the limitations of each component in the four-component pipeline of FActScore in the multilingual setting. We introduce a new dataset for FActScore on texts generated by strong multilingual LLMs. Our evaluation shows that LLMs exhibit distinct behaviors in both fact extraction and fact scoring tasks. No LLM produces consistent and reliable FActScore across languages with varying levels of resources. We also find that the knowledge source plays an important role in the quality of the estimated FActScore. Using Wikipedia as the knowledge source may hinder the true FActScore of long-form text due to its limited coverage in medium- and low-resource languages. We also incorporate three mitigations to our knowledge source that ultimately improve FActScore estimation across all languages.",

However, current MLLMs are surprisingly poor at understanding webpage screenshots and generating their corresponding HTML code. To address this problem, we propose Web2Code, a benchmark consisting of a new large-scale webpage-to-code dataset for instruction tuning and an evaluation framework for the webpage understanding and HTML code translation abilities of MLLMs. For dataset construction, we leverage pretrained LLMs to enhance existing webpage-to-code datasets as well as generate a diverse pool of new webpages rendered into images. Specifically, the inputs are webpage images and instructions, while the responses are the webpage's HTML code. We further include diverse natural language QA pairs about the webpage content in the responses to enable a more comprehensive understanding of the web content. To evaluate model performance in these tasks, we develop an evaluation framework for testing MLLMs' abilities in webpage understanding and web-to-code generation. Extensive experiments show that our proposed dataset is beneficial not only to our proposed tasks but also in the general visual domain, while previous datasets result in worse performance. We hope our work will contribute to the development of general MLLMs suitable for web-based content generation and task automation. Our data and code will be available at this https URL.",

LLMs with visual inputs, i.e., Vision Language Models (VLMs), have the capacity to process state information as visual-textual prompts and generate optimal policy decisions in text. To train such action policy VLMs, we first introduce an automated pipeline to generate diverse high-quality robotics instruction data from existing behavior cloning data. A VLM finetuned with the resulting collection of datasets based on a conversation-style formulation tailored for robotics tasks, can generate meaningful robot action policy decisions.

Moreover, there is no clear streaming solution for either style, especially considering the solution should generalize to speech multitask. We reformulate streamable SpeechLLM as a read-write policy problem and unifies the offline and streaming research with BESTOW architecture. Hence we demonstrate the first open-source SpeechLLM solution that enables Streaming and Multitask at scale (beyond ASR) at the same time. This streamable solution achieves very strong performance on a wide range of speech tasks (ASR, AST, SQA, unseen DynamicSuperb).

To address these issues, we propose a novel framework capable of generating more faithful rationales and, more importantly, matching performance with classifier-based black-box scoring systems. We first mimic the human assessment process by querying Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate a thought tree. We then summarise intermediate assessment decisions from each thought tree path for creating synthetic rationale data and rationale preference data. Finally, we utilise the generated synthetic data to calibrate LLMs through a two-step training process: supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our framework achieves a 38% assessment performance improvement in the QWK score compared to prior work while producing higher-quality rationales, as recognised by human evaluators and LLMs. Our work sheds light on the effectiveness of performing preference optimization using synthetic preference data obtained from thought tree paths.",

Existing automated writing evaluation systems primarily use basic surface linguistic features to detect coherence in writing. However, little effort has been made to correct the detected incoherence, which could significantly benefit L2 language learners seeking to improve their writing. To bridge this gap, we introduce DECOR, a novel benchmark that includes expert annotations for detecting incoherence in L2 English writing, identifying the underlying reasons, and rewriting the incoherent sentences. To our knowledge, DECOR is the first coherence assessment dataset specifically designed for improving L2 English writing, featuring pairs of original incoherent sentences alongside their expert-rewritten counterparts. Additionally, we fine-tuned models to automatically detect and rewrite incoherence in student essays. We find that incorporating specific reasons for incoherence during fine-tuning consistently improves the quality of the rewrites, achieving a result that is favored in both automatic and human evaluations.",

Retrieval-augmented reasoning represents a promising approach.

To address this, we propose Beam Aggregation Reasoning, BeamAggR, a reasoning framework for knowledge-intensive multi-hop QA. BeamAggR explores and prioritizes promising answers at each hop of question. Concretely, we parse the complex questions into trees, which include atom and composite questions, followed by bottom-up reasoning. For atomic questions, the LLM conducts reasoning on multi-source knowledge to get answer candidates. For composite questions, the LLM combines beam candidates, explores multiple reasoning paths through probabilistic aggregation, and prioritizes the most promising trajectory. Extensive experiments on four open-domain multi-hop reasoning datasets show that our method significantly outperforms SOTA methods by 8.5%. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that BeamAggR elicits better knowledge collaboration and answer aggregation.",

        "abstract": "Segmenting text into fine-grained units of meaning is important to a wide range of NLP applications. The default approach of segmenting text into sentences is often insufficient, especially since sentences are usually complex enough to include multiple units of meaning that merit separate treatment in the downstream task. We focus on the task of abstractive proposition segmentation: transforming text into simple, self-contained, well-formed sentences. Several recent works have demonstrated the utility of proposition segmentation with few-shot prompted LLMs for downstream tasks such as retrieval-augmented grounding and fact verification. However, this approach does not scale to large amounts of text and may not always extract all the facts from the input text. In this paper, we first introduce evaluation metrics for the task to measure several dimensions of quality. We then propose a scalable, yet accurate, proposition segmentation model. We model proposition segmentation as a supervised task by training LLMs on existing annotated datasets and show that training yields significantly improved results. We further show that by using the fine-tuned LLMs as teachers for annotating large amounts of multi-domain synthetic distillation data, we can train smaller student models with results similar to the teacher LLMs. We then demonstrate that our technique leads to effective domain generalization, by annotating data in two domains outside the original training data and evaluating on them.

Based on the paradigm, we further propose a novel data synthesis approach that can automatically create questions and multi-step reasoning paths for an image in a bottom-up manner. Our approach divides the complex synthesis task into a few simple sub-tasks, and (almost entirely) relies on open-sourced models to accomplish the sub-tasks. Therefore, the entire synthesis process is reproducible and cost-efficient, and the synthesized data is quality guaranteed. With the approach, we construct 50k visual reasoning examples. Then, we develop a visual reasoner through supervised fine-tuning, which is capable of generally enhancing the reasoning abilities of a wide range of existing VLMs in a plug-and-play fashion.

Existing methods simply divide this task into two steps: summarization\nand translation, leading to the problem of error propagation. To handle that, we present\nan end-to-end CLS framework, which we refer to as Neural Cross-Lingual Summarization\n(NCLS), for the first time. Moreover, we propose to further improve NCLS by incorporating two related tasks, monolingual summarization and machine translation, into the training process of CLS under multi-task learning. Due to the lack of supervised CLS data,\nwe propose a round-trip translation strategy\nto acquire two high-quality large-scale CLS\ndatasets based on existing monolingual summarization datasets. Experimental results have\nshown that our NCLS achieves remarkable improvement over traditional pipeline methods\non both English-to-Chinese and Chinese-toEnglish CLS human-corrected test sets. In addition, NCLS with multi-task learning can further significantly improve the quality of generated summaries.

However, the effectiveness of text clustering heavily relies on the choice of textual embeddings and clustering algorithms. We argue that recent advances in large language models (LLMs) can potentially improve this task. In this research, we investigated how different textual embeddings\u2014particularly those used in LLMs\u2014and clustering algorithms affect how text datasets are clustered. A series of experiments were conducted to assess how embeddings influence clustering results, the role played by dimensionality reduction through summarisation, and model size adjustment. Findings reveal that LLM embeddings excel at capturing subtleties in structured language, while BERT leads the lightweight options in performance. In addition, we observe that increasing model dimensionality and employing summarization techniques do not consistently lead to improvements in clustering efficiency, suggesting that these strategies require careful analysis to use in real-life models. These results highlight a complex balance between the need for refined text representation and computational feasibility in text clustering applications. This study extends traditional text clustering frameworks by incorporating embeddings from LLMs, providing a path for improved methodologies, while informing new avenues for future research in various types of textual analysis.",

We investigate a slate of NLP tasks which rely on knowledge - either factual or common sense, and ask systems to use a subset of CCNet - the Sphere corpus - as a knowledge source. In contrast to Wikipedia, otherwise a common background corpus in KI-NLP, Sphere is orders of magnitude larger and better reflects the full diversity of knowledge on the web. Despite potential gaps in coverage, challenges of scale, lack of structure and lower quality, we find that retrieval from Sphere enables a state of the art system to match and even outperform Wikipedia-based models on several tasks.

To catalyze research on models that condition on specific informa- tion in large textual resources, we present a benchmark for knowledge-intensive language tasks (KILT). All tasks in KILT are grounded in the same snapshot of Wikipedia, reduc- ing engineering turnaround through the re- use of components, as well as accelerating research into task-agnostic memory architec- tures. We test both task-specific and gen- eral baselines, evaluating downstream perfor- mance in addition to the ability of the mod-\nin open-domain question answering (Chen et al., 2017) models need to find answers within a large corpus of text. Fact checking a claim (Thorne et al., 2018a) requires models to find evidence, often on the web. In knowledgeable open dialogue (Dinan et al., 2019), models need access to knowledge from large corpora to sustain informed conversa- tions.\nIn general, solving knowledge-intensive tasks requires\u2013even for humans\u2013access to a large body of information. Like in Information Retrieval (IR) this involves satisfying an information need lever- aging large collections of text (Manning et al., 2008). However, while IR focuses of finding rel- evant material (usually documents), the tasks we consider focus on more fine-grained behavior, such as producing specific answers to queries. For such knowledge-intensive tasks, general infrastructure and architectures across tasks have yet to emerge, and fundamental research questions remain open. For example, while it was long assumed that non- parametric and explicit memory accessed through retrieval is strictly required for competitive re- sults (Chen et al., 2017), recent large pre-trained sequence-to-sequence models such as T5 (Raffel et al., 2019a) and BART (Lewis et al., 2019) store all knowledge in their parameters while performing remarkably well (Petroni et al., 2019). Likewise, while the classical approach of information extrac- tion for populating a Knowledge Base (KB, Riedel et al., 2013; Surdeanu and Ji, 2014) seems out- of-fashion, recent results show that they remain contenders (Fan et al., 2019a; Xiong et al., 2019).\nWhile there are numerous datasets for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. Thorne et al., 2018a; Dinan et al., 2019; Kwiatkowski et al., 2019, to name just a few), it is difficult to answer the above questions generally across them. Each dataset comes in a different format, is pre-processed with different assumptions, and requires different loaders, evaluations, and analysis\nels to provide provenance. we find that\na shared dense vector index coupled with\na seq2seq model is a strong baseline, out-\nperforming more tailor-made approaches for fact checking, open-domain question answer- ing and dialogue, and yielding competitive re- sults on entity linking and slot filling, by gen- erating disambiguated text.

The experiments demonstrate that DuReaderretrieval is challenging and a num- ber of problems remain unsolved, such as the salient phrase mismatch and the syntactic mis- match between queries and paragraphs.

        "abstract": "Synthetic data generation has gained significant attention recently for its utility in training large vision and language models. However, the application of synthetic data to the training of multimodal context-augmented generation systems has been relatively unexplored. This gap in existing work is important because existing vision and language models (VLMs) are not trained specifically for context-augmented generation. Resources for adapting such models are therefore crucial for enabling their use in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) settings, where a retriever is used to gather relevant information that is then subsequently provided to a generative model via context augmentation. To address this challenging problem, we generate SK-VQA: a large synthetic multimodal dataset containing over 2 million question-answer pairs which require external knowledge to determine the final answer. Our dataset is both larger and significantly more diverse than existing resources of its kind, possessing over 11x more unique questions and containing images from a greater variety of sources than previously-proposed datasets. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that our synthetic dataset can not only serve as a challenging benchmark, but is also highly effective for adapting existing generative multimodal models for context-augmented generation.",

(2) Specific instructions within a singular application lack adequacy for assessing the multi-dimensional reasoning and decision-making capacities of LLM mobile agents. (3) Current evaluation metrics are insufficient to accurately assess the process of sequential actions. To this end, we propose Mobile-Bench, a novel benchmark for evaluating the capabilities of LLM-based mobile agents. First, we expand conventional UI operations by incorporating 103 collected APIs to accelerate the efficiency of task completion. Subsequently, we collect evaluation data by combining real user queries with augmentation from LLMs. To better evaluate different levels of planning capabilities for mobile agents, our data is categorized into three distinct groups: SAST, SAMT, and MAMT, reflecting varying levels of task complexity. Mobile-Bench comprises 832 data entries, with more than 200 tasks specifically designed to evaluate multi-APP collaboration scenarios.

DoFaiR consists of 756 meticulously fact-checked test instances to reveal the factuality tax of various diversity prompts through an automated evidence-supported evaluation pipeline. Experiments on DoFaiR unveil that diversity-oriented instructions increase the number of different gender and racial groups in DALLE-3's generations at the cost of historically inaccurate demographic distributions. To resolve this issue, we propose Fact-Augmented Intervention (FAI), which instructs a Large Language Model (LLM) to reflect on verbalized or retrieved factual information about gender and racial compositions of generation subjects in history, and incorporate it into the generation context of T2I models. By orienting model generations using the reflected historical truths, FAI significantly improves the demographic factuality under diversity interventions while preserving diversity.",

        "abstract": "Proving mathematical theorems using computer-verifiable formal languages like Lean significantly impacts mathematical reasoning. One approach to formal theorem proving involves generating complete proofs using Large Language Models (LLMs) based on Natural Language (NL) proofs. Similar methods have shown promising results in code generation. However, most modern LLMs exhibit suboptimal performance due to the scarcity of aligned NL and Formal Language (FL) theorem-proving data. This scarcity results in a paucity of methodologies for training LLMs and techniques to fully utilize their capabilities in composing formal proofs. To address the challenges, this paper proposes **TheoremLlama**, an end-to-end framework to train a general-purpose LLM to become a Lean4 expert. This framework encompasses NL-FL aligned dataset generation methods, training approaches for the LLM formal theorem prover, and techniques for LLM Lean4 proof writing. Using the dataset generation method, we provide *Open Bootstrapped Theorems* (OBT), an NL-FL aligned and bootstrapped dataset. A key innovation in this framework is the NL-FL bootstrapping method, where NL proofs are integrated into Lean4 code for training datasets, leveraging the NL reasoning ability of LLMs for formal reasoning. The **TheoremLlama** framework achieves cumulative accuracies of 36.48% and 33.61% on MiniF2F-Valid and Test datasets respectively, surpassing the GPT-4 baseline of 22.95% and 25.41%.

In real-world software stacks, significant SE effort is spent developing foundational system software like the Linux kernel. Unlike application-level software, a systems codebase like Linux is multilingual (low-level C/Assembly/Bash/Rust); gigantic (>20 million lines); critical (impacting billions of devices worldwide), and highly concurrent (involving complex multi-threading). To evaluate if ML models are useful while developing such large-scale systems-level software, we introduce kGym (a platform) and kBench (a dataset). The kGym platform provides a SE environment for large-scale experiments on the Linux kernel, including compiling and running kernels in parallel across several virtual machines, detecting operations and crashes, inspecting logs, and querying and patching the code base. We use kGym to facilitate evaluation on kBench, a crash resolution benchmark drawn from real-world Linux kernel bugs. An example bug in kBench contains crashing stack traces, a bug-reproducer file, a developer-written fix, and other associated data. To understand current performance, we conduct baseline experiments by prompting LLMs to resolve Linux kernel crashes. Our initial evaluations reveal that the best performing LLM achieves 0.72% and 5.38% in the unassisted and assisted (i.e., buggy files disclosed to the model) settings, respectively. These results highlight the need for further research to enhance model performance in SE tasks. Improving performance on kBench requires models to master new learning skills, including understanding the cause of crashes and repairing faults, writing memory-safe and hardware-aware code, and understanding concurrency. As a result, this work opens up multiple avenues of research at the intersection of machine learning and systems software.",

        "abstract": "Recently, many studies have demonstrated that exclusively incorporating OCR-derived text and spatial layouts with large language models (LLMs) can be highly effective for document understanding tasks. However, existing methods that integrate spatial layouts with text have limitations, such as producing overly long text sequences or failing to fully leverage the autoregressive traits of LLMs. In this work, we introduce Interleaving Layout and Text in a Large Language Model (LayTextLLM)} for document understanding. In particular, LayTextLLM projects each bounding box to a single embedding and interleaves it with text, efficiently avoiding long sequence issues while leveraging autoregressive traits of LLMs. LayTextLLM not only streamlines the interaction of layout and textual data but also shows enhanced performance in Key Information Extraction (KIE) and Visual Question Answering (VQA). Comprehensive benchmark evaluations reveal significant improvements, with a 27.0% increase on KIE tasks and 24.1% on VQA tasks compared to previous state-of-the-art document understanding MLLMs, as well as a 15.5% improvement over other SOTA OCR-based LLMs on KIE tasks.",

Recent works aimed to boost the performance of CRQ through alignment. However, they are designed for one specific retrieval system, which potentially results in poor generalization. To overcome this limitation, we present a novel framework AdaCQR. By aligning reformulation models with both term-based and semantic-based retrieval systems, AdaCQR enhances the generalizability of information-seeking queries across diverse retrieval environments through a dual-phase training strategy. We also developed two effective approaches for acquiring superior labels and diverse input candidates, boosting the efficiency and robustness of the framework. Experimental evaluations on the TopiOCQA and QReCC datasets demonstrate that AdaCQR significantly outperforms existing methods, offering both quantitative and qualitative improvements in conversational query reformulation.",

        "abstract": "Advancing representation learning in specialized fields like medicine remains challenging due to the scarcity of expert annotations for text and images. To tackle this issue, we present a novel two-stage framework designed to extract high-quality factual statements from free-text radiology reports in order to improve the representations of text encoders and, consequently, their performance on various downstream tasks. In the first stage, we propose a \\textit{Fact Extractor} that leverages large language models (LLMs) to identify factual statements from well-curated domain-specific datasets. In the second stage, we introduce a \\textit{Fact Encoder} (CXRFE) based on a BERT model fine-tuned with objective functions designed to improve its representations using the extracted factual data. Our framework also includes a new embedding-based metric (CXRFEScore) for evaluating chest X-ray text generation systems, leveraging both stages of our approach. Extensive evaluations show that our fact extractor and encoder outperform current state-of-the-art methods in tasks such as sentence ranking, natural language inference, and label extraction from radiology reports. Additionally, our metric proves to be more robust and effective than existing metrics commonly used in the radiology report generation literature.

While in some cases, generative monoculture enhances performance (e.g., LLMs more often produce efficient code), the dangers are exacerbated in others (e.g., LLMs refuse to share diverse opinions). As LLMs are increasingly used in high-impact settings such as education and web search, careful maintenance of LLM output diversity is essential to ensure a variety of facts and perspectives are preserved over time. We experimentally demonstrate the prevalence of generative monoculture through analysis of book review and code generation tasks, and find that simple countermeasures such as altering sampling or prompting strategies are insufficient to mitigate the behavior. Moreover, our results suggest that the root causes of generative monoculture are likely embedded within the LLM's alignment processes, suggesting a need for developing fine-tuning paradigms that preserve or promote diversity.",

        "abstract": "We uncover a surprising multilingual bias occurring in a popular class of multimodal vision-language models (VLMs). Including an image in the query to a LLaVA-style VLM significantly increases the likelihood of the model returning an English response, regardless of the language of the query. This paper investigates the causes of this loss with a two-pronged approach that combines extensive ablation of the design space with a mechanistic analysis of the models' internal representations of image and text inputs. Both approaches indicate that the issue stems in the language modelling component of the LLaVA model. Statistically, we find that switching the language backbone for a bilingual language model has the strongest effect on reducing this error. Mechanistically, we provide compelling evidence that visual inputs are not mapped to a similar space as text ones, and that intervening on intermediary attention layers can reduce this bias. Our findings provide important insights to researchers and engineers seeking to understand the crossover between multimodal and multilingual spaces, and contribute to the goal of developing capable and inclusive VLMs for non-English contexts.",

Initial studies report the capability of LLMs to support process analysis and even, to some extent, that they are able to reason about how processes work. This latter property suggests that LLMs could also be used to tackle process mining tasks that benefit from an understanding of process behavior. Examples of such tasks include (semantic) anomaly detection and next activity prediction, which both involve considerations of the meaning of activities and their inter-relations. In this paper, we investigate the capabilities of LLMs to tackle such semantics-aware process mining tasks. Furthermore, whereas most works on the intersection of LLMs and process mining only focus on testing these models out of the box, we provide a more principled investigation of the utility of LLMs for process mining, including their ability to obtain process mining knowledge post-hoc by means of in-context learning and supervised fine-tuning. Concretely, we define three process mining tasks that benefit from an understanding of process semantics and provide extensive benchmarking datasets for each of them. Our evaluation experiments reveal that (1) LLMs fail to solve challenging process mining tasks out of the box and when provided only a handful of in-context examples, (2) but they yield strong performance when fine-tuned for these tasks, consistently surpassing smaller, encoder-based language models.",

        "abstract": "The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has necessitated the adoption of parallel training techniques, involving the deployment of thousands of GPUs to train a single model. Unfortunately, we have found that the efficiency of current parallel training is often suboptimal, largely due to the following two main issues. Firstly, hardware failures are inevitable, leading to interruptions in the training tasks. The inability to quickly identify the faulty components results in a substantial waste of GPU resources. Secondly, since GPUs must wait for parameter synchronization to complete before proceeding to the next round of computation, network congestions can greatly increase the waiting time for GPUs. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a communication-driven solution, namely the C4 . The key insights of C4 are two folds. First, in parallel training, collective communication exhibits periodic and homogeneous characteristics, so any anomalies are certainly due to some form of hardware malfunction. By leveraging this feature, C4 can rapidly identify the faulty components, swiftly isolate the anomaly, and restart the task, thereby avoiding resource wastage caused by delays in anomaly detection. Second, the predictable communication model of collective communication, involving few large flows, allows C4 to efficiently execute traffic planning, substantially reducing network congestion. C4 has been extensively implemented across our production systems, cutting error-induced overhead by roughly 30% and enhancing runtime performance by about 15% for certain applications with moderate communication costs.",

This rapid advancement has eclipsed the\ngrowth of open-source datasets available for large-scale LLM pretraining. In this\npaper, we introduce Zyda (Zyphra Dataset), a dataset under a permissive license\ncomprising 1.3 trillion tokens, assembled by integrating several major respected\nopen-source datasets into a single, high-quality corpus. We apply rigorous filtering\nand deduplication processes, both within and across datasets, to maintain and\nenhance the quality derived from the original datasets. Our evaluations show that\nZyda not only competes favorably with other open datasets like Dolma, FineWeb,\nand RefinedWeb, but also substantially improves the performance of comparable\nmodels from the Pythia suite.

        "abstract": "With the success of large-scale pre-training and multilingual modeling in Natural Language Processing (NLP), recent years have seen a proliferation of large, web-mined text datasets covering hundreds of languages. We manually audit the quality of 205 language-specific corpora released with five major public datasets (CCAligned, ParaCrawl, WikiMatrix, OSCAR, mC4). Lower-resource corpora have systematic issues: At least 15 corpora have no usable text, and a significant fraction contains less than 50% sentences of acceptable quality. In addition, many are mislabeled or use nonstandard/ambiguous language codes. We demonstrate that these issues are easy to detect even for non-proficient speakers, and supplement the human audit with automatic analyses. Finally, we recommend techniques to evaluate and improve multilingual corpora and discuss potential risks that come with low-quality data releases.",

        "abstract": "With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their ubiquitous deployment in diverse domains, measuring language model behavior on realistic data is imper- ative. For example, a company deploying a client-facing chatbot must ensure that the model will not respond to client requests with profanity. Current evaluations approach this problem using small, domain-specific datasets with human-curated labels. These evaluation sets are often sampled from a narrow and simplified distribution, and data sources can unknowingly be leaked into the training set, which can lead to misleading evaluations. To bypass these drawbacks, we propose a framework for self-supervised evaluation of LLMs by analyzing their sensitivity or invariance to transformations on the input text. Self-supervised evaluation can directly monitor LLM behavior on datasets collected in the wild or streamed during live model deployment. We demonstrate self-supervised evaluation strategies for measuring closed-book knowledge, toxicity, and long-range context dependence, in addition to sensitivity to grammatical structure and tokenization errors. When comparisons to similar human-labeled benchmarks are available, we find strong correlations between self-supervised and human-supervised evaluations. The self-supervised paradigm complements current evaluation strategies that rely on labeled data. Code is available at https://github.com/neelsjain/BYOD.",

        "abstract": "Existing question answering datasets focus on dealing with homogeneous information, based either only on text or KB/Table information alone. However, as human knowledge is dis- tributed over heterogeneous forms, using ho- mogeneous information alone might lead to severe coverage problems. To fill in the gap, we present HybridQA1, a new large-scale question-answering dataset that requires rea- soning on heterogeneous information. Each question is aligned with a Wikipedia table and multiple free-form corpora linked with the en- tities in the table. The questions are designed to aggregate both tabular information and text information, i.e., lack of either form would ren- der the question unanswerable. We test with three different models: 1) a table-only model. 2) text-only model. 3) a hybrid model that combines heterogeneous information to find the answer. The experimental results show that the EM scores obtained by two baselines are below 20%, while the hybrid model can achieve an EM over 40%. This gap suggests the necessity to aggregate heterogeneous in- formation in HybridQA. However, the hybrid model\u2019s score is still far behind human perfor- mance. Hence, HybridQA can serve as a chal- lenging benchmark to study question answer- ing with heterogeneous information.",

In this work, we propose a novel framework DECAF that jointly generates both logi- cal forms and direct answers, and then combines the merits of them to get the final answers.

In this work, we perform a de- tailed study of the test sets of three popular open-domain benchmark datasets with respect to these competencies.

Therefore, it is important to consider the time dimension and empower the existing QA models to reason over time. However, the existing QA datasets contain rather few time-sensitive questions, hence not suitable for diagnosing or benchmarking the model\u2019s temporal reasoning capability. In order to promote research in this direction, we propose to construct a time-sensitive QA dataset. The dataset is constructed by 1) mining time-evolving facts from WikiData and aligning them to their corresponding Wikipedia page, 2) employing crowd workers to verify and calibrate these noisy facts, 3) generating question-answer pairs based on the annotated time-sensitive facts. Our dataset poses challenges in the aspect of both temporal understanding and temporal reasoning. We evaluate different SoTA long-document QA systems like BigBird and FiD on our dataset. The best- performing model FiD can only achieve 46% accuracy, still far behind the human performance of 87%. We demonstrate that these models are still lacking the ability to perform consistent temporal reasoning. Therefore, we believe that our dataset could serve as a benchmark to develop NLP models more sensitive to temporal shifts.

Regard- ing the forget set, we provide four membership inference attack (MIA) methods and nine kinds of adversarial attack probes to rigorously test unlearning efficacy.

Yet, LLMs tend to \u201chal- lucinate\u201d content that conflicts with the re- trieved knowledge.

Concretely, we match LLM-generated passages with retrieved counterparts into com- patible pairs, based on discriminators trained with silver compatibility labels. Then a Fusion- in-Decoder-based (Izacard and Grave, 2021b) reader model handles passage pairs to arrive at the final answer. Experiments show that COMBO outperforms competitive baselines on three out of four tested open-domain QA benchmarks.

Some of these systems incorporate textual sources as additional evidence for the answering process, but cannot compute answers that are present in text alone. Conversely, the IR and NLP communities have addressed QA over text, but such systems barely utilize semantic data and knowledge. This paper presents a method for complex questions that can seamlessly operate over a mixture of RDF datasets and text corpora, or individual sources, in a unified framework. Our method, called UNIQORN, builds a context graph on-the-fly, by retrieving question-relevant evidences from the RDF data and/or a text corpus, using fine-tuned BERT models. The resulting graph typically contains all question-relevant evidences but also a lot of noise. UNIQORN copes with this input by a graph algorithm for Group Steiner Trees, that identifies the best answer candidates in the context graph. Experimental results on several benchmarks of complex questions with multiple entities and relations, show that UNIQORN significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods for heterogeneous QA \u2013 in a full training mode, as well as in zero-shot settings.

        "abstract": "In order to address increasing demands of real-world applications, the research for knowledge-intensive NLP (KI-NLP) should advance by capturing the challenges of a truly open-domain environment: web-scale knowl- edge, lack of structure, inconsistent quality and noise. To this end, we propose a new setup for evaluating existing knowledge inten- sive tasks in which we generalize the back- ground corpus to a universal web snapshot. We investigate a slate of NLP tasks which rely on knowledge - either factual or com- mon sense, and ask systems to use a subset of CCNet\u2014the SPHERE corpus\u2014as a knowl- edge source. In contrast to Wikipedia, other- wise a common background corpus in KI-NLP, SPHERE is orders of magnitude larger and bet- ter reflects the full diversity of knowledge on the web. Despite potential gaps in coverage, challenges of scale, lack of structure and lower quality, we find that retrieval from SPHERE en- ables a state of the art system to match and even outperform Wikipedia-based models on several tasks. We also observe that while a dense index can outperform a sparse BM25 baseline on Wikipedia, on SPHERE this is not yet possible. To facilitate further research and minimise the community\u2019s reliance on propri- etary, black-box search engines, we share our indices, evaluation metrics and infrastructure.",

        "abstract": "Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently been shown to be effective as automatic evaluators with simple prompting and in-context learning. In this work, we assemble 15 LLMs of four different size ranges and evaluate their output responses by preference ranking from the other LLMs as evaluators, such as System Star is better than System Square. We then evaluate the quality of ranking outputs introducing the COgnitive Bias Benchmark for LLMs as EvaluatoRs (COBBLER)1, a benchmark to measure six different cognitive biases in LLM evaluation outputs, such as the EGOCENTRIC bias where a model prefers to rank its own outputs highly in evaluation. We find that LLMs are biased text quality evaluators, exhibiting strong indications on our bias benchmark (average of 40% of comparisons across all models) within each of their evaluations that question their robustness as evaluators. Furthermore, we examine the correlation between human and machine preferences and calculate the average Rank-Biased Overlap (RBO) score to be 49.6%, indicating that machine preferences are misaligned with humans. According to our findings, LLMs may still be unable to be utilized for automatic annotation aligned with human preferences.",

Due to the two-stage nature of the task, most studies eval- uate the generation and detection separately, thereby presenting a challenge in unbiased, thorough, and applicable evaluations. In this paper, we introduce WaterBench, the first com- prehensive benchmark for LLM watermarks, in which we design three crucial factors: (1) For benchmarking procedure, to ensure an apples- to-apples comparison, we first adjust each wa- termarking method\u2019s hyper-parameter to reach the same watermarking strength, then jointly evaluate their generation and detection perfor- mance. (2) For task selection, we diversify the input and output length to form a five-category taxonomy, covering 9 tasks. (3) For evaluation metric, we adopt the GPT4-Judge for auto- matically evaluating the decline of instruction- following abilities after watermarking. We eval- uate 4 open-source watermarks on 2 LLMs under 2 watermarking strengths and observe the common struggles for current methods on maintaining the generation quality.

However, both humans and LLMs have limitations, i.e., inherent subjectiv- ity and unreliable judgments, particularly for open-ended tasks that require adaptable met- rics tailored to diverse task requirements. To explore the synergy between humans and LLM- based evaluators and address the challenges of existing inconsistent evaluation criteria in open- ended NLG tasks, we propose a Collaborative Evaluation pipeline COEVAL, involving the design of a checklist of task-specific criteria and the detailed evaluation of texts, in which LLM generates initial ideation, and then hu- mans engage in scrutiny. We conducted a series of experiments to investigate the mutual effects between LLMs and humans in COEVAL. Re- sults show that, by utilizing LLMs, COEVAL effectively evaluates lengthy texts, saving sig- nificant time and reducing human evaluation outliers.

In the context of Traditional Chinese, there is a scarcity of comprehensive and diverse benchmarks to evaluate the capabilities of language models, despite the existence of certain benchmarks such as DRCD, TTQA, CMDQA, and FGC dataset. To address this gap, we propose a novel set of benchmarks that leverage existing English datasets and are tailored to evaluate language models in Traditional Chinese.

The proposed benchmarks offer a comprehensive evaluation framework, enabling the assessment of language models\u2019 capabilities across different tasks.

Recent models such as CoCondenser, RetroMAE, and LexMAE argue that the MLM task is not sufficient enough to pre- train a transformer network for retrieval and hence propose vari- ous tasks to do so. Intrigued by those novel methods, we noticed that all these models used different finetuning protocols, making it hard to assess the benefits of middle training. We propose in this paper a benchmark of CoCondenser, RetroMAE, and LexMAE, under the same finetuning conditions. We compare both dense and sparse approaches under various finetuning protocols and middle training on different collections (MS MARCO, Wikipedia or Tripclick). We use additional middle training baselines, such as a standard MLM finetuning on the retrieval collection, option- ally augmented by a CLS predicting the passage term frequency. For the sparse approach, our study reveals that there is almost no statistical difference between those methods: the more effec- tive the finetuning procedure is, the less difference there is be- tween those models. For the dense approach, RetroMAE using MS MARCO as middle-training collection shows excellent results in almost all the settings. Finally, we show that middle training on the retrieval collection, thus adapting the language model to it, is a critical factor. Overall, a better experimental setup should be adopted to evaluate middle training methods. Code available at https://github.com/naver/splade/tree/benchmarch-SIGIR23",

        "abstract": "The work of neural retrieval so far focuses on ranking short texts and is challenged with long documents. There are many cases where the users want to find a relevant passage within a long document from a huge corpus, e.g. Wikipedia articles, research papers, etc. We propose and name this task Document-Aware Passage Retrieval (DAPR). While analyzing the errors of the State-of-The-Art (SoTA) passage retrievers, we find the major errors (53.5%) are due to missing document context. This drives us to build a benchmark for this task including multiple datasets from heterogeneous domains. In the experiments, we extend the SoTA passage retrievers with document context via (1) hybrid retrieval with BM25 and (2) con- textualized passage representations, which in- form the passage representation with document context. We find despite that hybrid retrieval performs the strongest on the mixture of the easy and the hard queries, it completely fails on the hard queries that require document-context understanding. On the other hand, contextual- ized passage representations (e.g. prepending document titles) achieve good improvement on these hard queries, but overall they also per- form rather poorly. Our created benchmark enables future research on developing and com- paring retrieval systems for the new task. The code and the data are available",

Unlike existing pretrained language models, SPECTER can be easily applied to downstream applications without task-specific fine-tuning.

        "abstract": "Logs are a common way to record detailed run- time information in software. As modern software systems evolve in scale and complexity, logs have become indispensable to understanding the internal states of the system. At the same time however, manually inspecting logs has become impractical. In recent times, there has been more emphasis on statistical and machine learning (ML) based methods for analyzing logs. While the results have shown promise, most of the literature focuses on algorithms and state-of-the-art (SOTA), while largely ignoring the practical aspects. In this paper we demonstrate our end- to-end log classification pipeline, Linnaeus. Besides showing the more traditional ML flow, we also demonstrate our solutions for adaptability and re-use, integration towards large scale software development processes, and how we cope with lack of labelled data. We hope Linnaeus can serve as a blueprint for, and inspire the integration of, various ML based solutions in other large scale industrial settings.",

As a cornerstone of BRE, robust BNER system is required to\nidentify the mentioned NEs in plain texts for further relation extraction stage. However,\nthe current BNER corpora, which play important roles in these tasks, paid less attention\nto achieve the criteria for BRE task. In this study, we present Revised JNLPBA corpus,\nthe revision of JNLPBA corpus, to broaden the applicability of a NER corpus from\nBNER to BRE task. We preserve the original entity types including protein, DNA,\nRNA, cell line and cell type while all the abstracts in JNLPBA corpus are manually\ncurated by domain experts again basis on the new annotation guideline focusing on the\nspecific NEs instead of general terms. Simultaneously, several imperfection issues in\nJNLPBA are pointed out and made up in the new corpus.

        "abstract": "Introduction: The scientific publishing landscape is expanding rapidly, creating challenges for researchers to stay up-to-date with the evolution of the literature. Natural Language Processing (NLP) has emerged as a potent approach to automating knowledge extraction from this vast amount of publications and preprints. Tasks such as Named-Entity Recognition (NER) and Named-Entity Linking (NEL), in conjunction with context-dependent semantic interpretation, offer promising and complementary approaches to extracting structured information and revealing key concepts.\nResults: We present the SourceData-NLP dataset produced through the routine curation of papers during the publication process. A unique feature of this dataset is its emphasis on the annotation of bioentities in figure legends. We annotate eight classes of biomedical entities (small molecules, gene products, subcellular components, cell lines, cell types, tissues, organisms, and diseases), their role in the experimental design, and the nature of the experimental method as an additional class. SourceData- NLP contains more than 620,000 annotated biomedical entities, curated from 18,689 figures in 3,223 papers in molecular and cell biology. We illustrate the dataset\u2019s usefulness by assessing BioLinkBERT and PubmedBERT, two transformers-based models, fine-tuned on the SourceData-NLP dataset for NER. We also introduce a novel context-dependent semantic task that infers whether an entity is the target of a controlled intervention or the object of measurement.\nConclusions: SourceData-NLP\u2019s scale highlights the value of integrating curation into publishing. Models trained with SourceData-NLP will furthermore enable the development of tools able to extract causal hypotheses from the literature and assemble them into knowledge graphs.\nAvailability: To facilitate researchers\u2019 access to SourceData-NLP, we provide open-source access to the source code for the raw data (https://github.com/source-data/soda-data), machine- learning-ready data (https://huggingface.co/datasets/EMBO/SourceData), and generated models (https://github.com/source-data/soda-model).",

        "abstract": "The wide adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) has enabled a wide range of applications leveraging EHR data. However, the meaningful use of EHR data largely depends on our ability to efficiently extract and consolidate information embedded in clinical text where natural language processing (NLP) techniques are essential. Semantic textual similarity (STS) that measures the semantic similarity between text snippets plays a significant role in many NLP applications. In the general NLP domain, STS shared tasks have made available a huge collection of text snippet pairs with manual annotations in various domains. In the clinical domain, STS can enable us to detect and eliminate redundant information that may lead to a reduction in cognitive burden and an improvement in the clinical decision-making process. This paper elaborates our efforts to assemble a resource for STS in the medical domain, MedSTS. It consists of a total of 174,629 sentence pairs gathered from a clinical corpus at Mayo Clinic. A subset of MedSTS (MedSTS_ann) containing 1,068 sentence pairs was annotated by two medical experts with semantic similarity scores of 0-5 (low to high similarity). We further analyzed the medical concepts in the MedSTS corpus, and tested four STS systems on the MedSTS_ann corpus. In the future, we will organize a shared task by releasing the MedSTS_ann corpus to motivate the community to tackle the real world clinical problems.",

RoMQA contains clus- ters of questions that are derived from re- lated constraints mined from the Wikidata knowledge graph. RoMQA evaluates robust- ness of QA models to varying constraints by measuring worst-case performance within each question cluster. Compared to prior QA datasets, RoMQA has more human-written ques- tions that require reasoning over more evidence text and have, on average, many more cor- rect answers. In addition, human annotators rate RoMQA questions as more natural or likely to be asked by people. We evaluate state-of-the- art large language models in zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuning settings, and find that RoMQA is challenging: zero-shot and few-shot models per- form similarly to naive baselines, while super- vised retrieval methods perform well below gold evidence upper bounds. Moreover, existing mod- els are not robust to variations in question con- straints, but can be made more robust by tun- ing on clusters of related questions. Our results show that RoMQA is a challenging benchmark for large language models, and provides a quan- tifiable test to build more robust QA methods.",

However, as human knowledge is dis- tributed over heterogeneous forms, using ho- mogeneous information alone might lead to severe coverage problems. To fill in the gap, we present HybridQA1, a new large-scale question-answering dataset that requires rea- soning on heterogeneous information. Each question is aligned with a Wikipedia table and multiple free-form corpora linked with the en- tities in the table. The questions are designed to aggregate both tabular information and text information, i.e., lack of either form would ren- der the question unanswerable. We test with three different models: 1) a table-only model. 2) text-only model. 3) a hybrid model that combines heterogeneous information to find the answer. The experimental results show that the EM scores obtained by two baselines are below 20%, while the hybrid model can achieve an EM over 40%. This gap suggests the necessity to aggregate heterogeneous in- formation in HybridQA. However, the hybrid model\u2019s score is still far behind human perfor- mance. Hence, HybridQA can serve as a chal- lenging benchmark to study question answer- ing with heterogeneous information.",

        "abstract": "The conventional paradigm in neural question answering (QA) for narrative content is limited to a two-stage process: first, relevant text pas- sages are retrieved and, subsequently, a neural network for machine comprehension extracts the likeliest answer. However, both stages are largely isolated in the status quo and, hence, information from the two phases is never prop- erly fused. In contrast, this work proposes RankQA1: RankQA extends the conventional two-stage process in neural QA with a third stage that performs an additional answer re- ranking. The re-ranking leverages different features that are directly extracted from the QA pipeline, i. e., a combination of retrieval and comprehension features. While our inten- tionally simple design allows for an efficient, data-sparse estimation, it nevertheless outper- forms more complex QA systems by a signif- icant margin: in fact, RankQA achieves state- of-the-art performance on 3 out of 4 bench- mark datasets. Furthermore, its performance is especially superior in settings where the size of the corpus is dynamic. Here the answer re- ranking provides an effective remedy against the underlying noise-information trade-off due to a variable corpus size. As a consequence, RankQA represents a novel, powerful, and thus challenging baseline for future research in content-based QA.",

Large language models, even though they store an impressive amount of knowledge within their weights, are known to hallucinate facts when generating dialogue (Shuster et al., 2021); moreover, those facts are frozen in time at the point of model training. In contrast, we propose an approach that learns to generate an internet search query based on the context, and then conditions on the search results to fi- nally generate a response, a method that can employ up-to-the-minute relevant information. We train and evaluate such models on a newly collected dataset of human-human conversa- tions whereby one of the speakers is given access to internet search during knowledge- driven discussions in order to ground their re- sponses.

To this end, we first conduct large-scale pre-training on both common document corpus and dia- logue data with curriculum learning, so as to inject various world knowledge and dialogue abilities into ChatPLUG. Then, we collect a wide range of dialogue tasks spanning diverse features of knowledge, personality, multi-turn memory, and empathy, on which we further instruction tune ChatPLUG via unified nat- ural language instruction templates.

        "abstract": "Composing knowledge from multiple pieces of texts is a key challenge in multi-hop question answering. We present a multi-hop reasoning dataset, Question Answering via Sentence Composition (QASC), that requires retrieving facts from a large corpus and composing them to answer a multiple-choice question. QASC is the first dataset to offer two desirable properties: (a) the facts to be composed are an- notated in a large corpus, and (b) the decomposition into these facts is not evident from the question itself. The latter makes retrieval challenging as the system must introduce new con- cepts or relations in order to discover potential decomposi- tions. Further, the reasoning model must then learn to identify valid compositions of these retrieved facts using common- sense reasoning. To help address these challenges, we provide annotation for supporting facts as well as their composition. Guided by these annotations, we present a two-step approach to mitigate the retrieval challenges. We use other multiple- choice datasets as additional training data to strengthen the reasoning model. Our proposed approach improves over cur- rent state-of-the-art language models by 11% (absolute). The reasoning and retrieval problems, however, remain unsolved as this model still lags by 20% behind human performance.",

KBQA is considered a challenging task, particularly in parsing intricate questions into executable logical forms. Traditional semantic parsing (SP)-based methods require extensive data an- notations, which result in significant costs. Recently, the advent of few-shot in-context learning, powered by large language models (LLMs), has showcased promising capabili- ties. Yet, fully leveraging LLMs to parse questions into logical forms in low-resource scenarios poses a substantial challenge. To tackle these hurdles, we introduce Interactive- KBQA, a framework designed to generate logical forms through direct interaction with knowledge bases (KBs). Within this frame- work, we have developed three generic APIs for KB interaction. For each category of com- plex question, we devised exemplars to guide LLMs through the reasoning processes. Our method achieves competitive results on the We- bQuestionsSP, ComplexWebQuestions, KQA Pro, and MetaQA datasets with a minimal num- ber of examples (shots). Importantly, our ap- proach supports manual intervention, allowing for the iterative refinement of LLM outputs.

DuoRC contains 186,089 unique question- answer pairs created from a collection of 7680 pairs of movie plots where each pair in the collection reflects two versions of the same movie - one from Wikipedia and the other from IMDb - written by two different authors. We asked crowdsourced workers to create questions from one version of the plot and a different set of workers to extract or synthesize answers from the other ver- sion. This unique characteristic of DuoRC where questions and answers are created from different versions of a document nar- rating the same underlying story, ensures by design, that there is very little lexical overlap between the questions created from one version and the segments containing the answer in the other version. Further, since the two versions have different levels of plot detail, narration style, vocabulary, etc., answering questions from the second version requires deeper language under- standing and incorporating external back- ground knowledge. Additionally, the nar- rative style of passages arising from movie plots (as opposed to typical descriptive pas- sages in existing datasets) exhibits the need to perform complex reasoning over events across multiple sentences. Indeed, we ob- serve that state-of-the-art neural RC models which have achieved near human perfor- mance on the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkar et al., 2016b), even when coupled with tra-\nditional NLP techniques to address the chal- lenges presented in DuoRC exhibit very poor performance (F1 score of 37.42% on DuoRC v/s 86% on SQuAD dataset). This opens up several interesting research av- enues wherein DuoRC could complement other RC datasets to explore novel neural approaches for studying language under- standing.",

Due to the limitation in the availability of an- notators, most current multilingual datasets are created through translation, which cannot eval- uate such language-specific aspects. Therefore, we propose Multilingual CommonsenseQA (mCSQA) based on the construction process of CSQA but leveraging language models for a more efficient construction, e.g., by asking LM to generate questions/answers, refine answers and verify QAs followed by reduced human efforts for verification. Constructed dataset is a benchmark for cross-lingual language- transfer capabilities of multilingual LMs, and experimental results showed high language- transfer capabilities for questions that LMs could easily solve, but lower transfer capabil- ities for questions requiring deep knowledge or commonsense. This highlights the neces- sity of language-specific datasets for evalua- tion and training. Finally, our method demon- strated that multilingual LMs could create QA including language-specific knowledge, sig- nificantly reducing the dataset creation cost compared to manual creation.

We achieve this via Adversarial Filtering (AF), a data collection paradigm wherein a series of discriminators iteratively select an adversarial set of machine-generated wrong answers.

How- ever, recent advances in neural language models have already reached around 90% accuracy on variants of WSC. This raises an important question whether these models have truly ac- quired robust commonsense capabilities or whether they rely on spurious biases in the datasets that lead to an overestimation of the true capabilities of machine commonsense.\nTo investigate this question, we introduce WINOGRANDE, a large-scale dataset of 44k problems, inspired by the origi- nal WSC design, but adjusted to improve both the scale and the hardness of the dataset. The key steps of the dataset con- struction consist of (1) a carefully designed crowdsourcing procedure, followed by (2) systematic bias reduction using a novel AFLITE algorithm that generalizes human-detectable word associations to machine-detectable embedding associ- ations. The best state-of-the-art methods on WINOGRANDE achieve 59.4 \u2013 79.1%, which are \u223c15-35% (absolute) below human performance of 94.0%, depending on the amount of the training data allowed (2% \u2013 100% respectively).\nFurthermore, we establish new state-of-the-art results on five related benchmarks \u2014 WSC (\u2192 90.1%), DPR (\u2192 93.1%), COPA(\u2192 90.6%), KnowRef (\u2192 85.6%), and Winogender (\u2192 97.1%). These results have dual implications: on one hand, they demonstrate the effectiveness of WINOGRANDE when used as a resource for transfer learning. On the other hand, they raise a concern that we are likely to be overestimating the true capabilities of machine commonsense across all these benchmarks. We emphasize the importance of algorithmic bias reduction in existing and future benchmarks to mitigate such overestimation.",

        "abstract": "Conventional document retrieval techniques are mainly based on the index-retrieve paradigm. It is challenging to optimize pipelines based on this paradigm in an end-to-end manner. As an alternative, generative retrieval represents documents as identifiers (docid) and retrieves documents by generating docids, enabling end-toend modeling of document retrieval tasks. However, it is an open question how one should define the document identifiers. Current approaches to the task of defining document identifiers rely on fixed rule-based docids, such as the title of a document or the result of clustering BERT embeddings, which often fail to capture the complete semantic information of a document. We propose GenRet, a document tokenization learning method to address the challenge of defining document identifiers for generative retrieval. GenRet learns to tokenize documents into short discrete representations (i.e., docids) via a discrete auto-encoding approach. Three components are included in GenRet: (i) a tokenization model that produces docids for documents; (ii) a reconstruction model that learns to reconstruct a document based on a docid; and (iii) a sequence-to-sequence retrieval model that generates relevant document identifiers directly for a designated query. By using an auto-encoding framework, GenRet learns semantic docids in a fully end-to-end manner, where the produced docids can be reconstructed back to the original documents to ensure their semantics. We also develop a progressive training scheme to capture the autoregressive nature of docids and to stabilize training. We conduct experiments on the NQ320K, MS MARCO, and BEIR datasets to assess the effectiveness of GenRet. GenRet establishes the new state-of-the-art on the NQ320K dataset. Especially, compared to generative retrieval baselines, GenRet can achieve significant improvements on the unseen documents (e.g., at least +14% relative improvements in terms of R@1). Furthermore, GenRet can better represent and retrieve documents that have not been seen during the training phase compared to previous rule-based tokenization methods. GenRet also outperforms comparable baselines on MS MARCO and BEIR, demonstrating the method\u2019s generalizability.1",

        "abstract": "Pre-trained language models (PLMs) have established the new paradigm in the field of NLP. For more powerful PLMs, one of the most popular and successful way is to continuously scale up sizes of the models and the pre-training corpora. These large corpora are generally obtained by converging smaller ones from multiple sources, they are thus growing increasingly diverse. However, the side-effects of these colossal converged corpora remain understudied. In this paper, we identify the disadvantage of heterogeneous corpora from multiple sources for pre-training PLMs. Towards coordinated pre-training on diverse corpora, we further propose source prompts (SP), which explicitly prompt the model of the data source at the pre-training and fine-tuning stages. Results of extensive experiments demonstrate that PLMs pretrained with SP on diverse corpora gain significant improvement in various downstream tasks.",

        "abstract": "Language models typically need to be trained or finetuned in order to acquire new knowledge, which involves updating their weights. We instead envision language models that can simply read and memorize new data at inference time, thus acquiring new knowledge immediately. In this work, we extend language models with the ability to memorize the internal representations of past inputs. We demonstrate that an approximate kNN lookup into a non-differentiable memory of recent (key, value) pairs improves language modeling across various benchmarks and tasks, including generic webtext (C4), math papers (arXiv), books (PG-19), code (Github), as well as formal theorems (Isabelle). We show that the performance steadily improves when we increase the size of memory up to 262K tokens. On benchmarks including code and mathematics, we find that the model is capable of making use of newly defined functions and theorems during test time.",

        "abstract": "Large language models are trained on massive scrapes of the web, which are often unstructured, noisy, and poorly phrased. Current scaling laws show that learning from such data requires an abundance of both compute and data, which grows with the size of the model being trained. This is infeasible both because of the large compute costs and duration associated with pre-training, and the impending scarcity of high-quality data on the web. In this work, we propose Web Rephrase Augmented Pre-training (WRAP) that uses an off-the-shelf instruction-tuned model prompted to paraphrase documents on the web in specific styles such as \u201clike Wikipedia\u201d or in \u201cquestion-answer format\u201d to jointly pre-train LLMs on real and synthetic rephrases. First, we show that using WRAP on the C4 dataset, which is naturally noisy, speeds up pre-training by \u223c 3\u00d7. At the same pre-training compute budget, it improves perplexity by more than 10% on average across different subsets of the Pile, and improves zero-shot question answer accuracy across 13 tasks by more than 2%. Second, we investigate the impact of the re-phrasing style on the performance of the model, offering insights into how the composition of the training data can impact the performance of LLMs in OOD settings. Our gains are attributed to the fact that re-phrased synthetic data has higher utility than just real data because it (i) incorporates style diversity that closely reflects downstream evaluation style, and (ii) has higher \u2018quality\u2019 than web-scraped data.",

        "abstract": "In nuclear reaction experiments, the measured decay energy spectra can give insights into the shell structure of decaying systems. However, extracting the underlying physics from the measurements is challenging due to detector resolution and acceptance effects. The Richardson-Lucy (RL) algorithm, a deblurring method that is commonly used in optics and has proven to be a successful technique for restoring images, was applied to our experimental nuclear physics data. The only inputs to the method are the observed energy spectrum and the detector\u2019s response matrix also known as the transfer matrix. We demonstrate that the technique can help access information about the shell structure of particle-unbound systems from the measured decay energy spectrum that isn\u2019t immediately accessible via traditional approaches such as chi-square fitting. For a similar purpose, we developed a machine learning model that uses a deep neural network (DNN) classifier to identify resonance states from the measured decay energy spectrum. We tested the performance of both methods on simulated data and experimental measurements. Then, we applied both algorithms to the decay energy spectrum of 26O \u219224 O + n + n measured via invariant mass spectroscopy. The resonance states restored using the RL algorithm to deblur the measured decay energy spectrum agree with those found by the DNN classifier. Both deblurring and DNN approaches suggest that the raw decay energy spectrum of 26O exhibits three peaks at approximately 0.15 MeV, 1.50 MeV, and 5.00 MeV, with half-widths of 0.29 MeV, 0.80 MeV, and 1.85 MeV, respectively",

In this paper, we exploit\n textual reviews and item images together with ratings to tackle these\n limitations. Specifically, we first apply a proposed multi-modal aspect-aware\n topic model (MATM) on text reviews and item images to model users' preferences\n and items' features from different aspects, and also estimate the aspect\n importance of a user towards an item. Then the aspect importance is integrated\n into a novel aspect-aware latent factor model (ALFM), which learns user's and\n item's latent factors based on ratings. In particular, ALFM introduces a weight\n matrix to associate those latent factors with the same set of aspects in MATM,\n such that the latent factors could be used to estimate aspect ratings. Finally,\n the overall rating is computed via a linear combination of the aspect ratings,\n which are weighted by the corresponding aspect importance.

Our protocol hides contact relationships between users, prevents\n impersonation, and conceals which usernames are registered on the network.\n Pudding is Byzantine fault tolerant, remaining available and secure as long as\n less than one third of servers are crashed, unavailable, or malicious.

In this paper, we tried to incorporate BERT into this task.\n However, since BERT is based on the byte-pair-encoding (BPE) subword encoding,\n it is nontrivial to make BERT generate a word given the description. We propose\n a simple but effective method to make BERT generate the target word for this\n specific task. Besides, the cross-lingual reverse dictionary is the task to\n find the proper target word described in another language. Previous models have\n to keep two different word embeddings and learn to align these embeddings.\n Nevertheless, by using the Multilingual BERT (mBERT), we can efficiently\n conduct the cross-lingual reverse dictionary with one subword embedding, and\n the alignment between languages is not necessary. More importantly, mBERT can\n achieve remarkable cross-lingual reverse dictionary performance even without\n the parallel corpus, which means it can conduct the cross-lingual reverse\n dictionary with only corresponding monolingual data.

To characterize this, we further establish an\n analytical model. It reveals that their patterns in 1D, 2D and 3D imaging\n results are all comb-like, while those of targets are point-like.

The objective of the present chapter is to further our understanding of this dynamic by surfacing and examining 1) how online conspiracy narratives recontextualize prior knowledge by coupling it with heterogeneous antagonistic elements, and 2) how such recontextualizing narratives operate as connectors around which diverse actors might form narrative coalitions. To this end, the chapter offers an empirical analysis of links to prior knowledge in public messaging channels from the Pushshift Telegram dataset. Using transferable methods from the field of bibliometrics, we find that politically extreme Telegram channels engage with a variety of established knowledge sources, including scientific journals, scientific repositories and other sources associated with the system of scholarly communication. Channels engaging with shared knowledge sources thereby form narrative coalitions ranging from scientific and technological imaginaries to far-right extremist and antisemitic conspiracy theories. Our analysis of these coalitions reveals (i) linguistic, political, and thematic forces that shape conspiracy narratives, (ii) emerging ideological, epistemological and ontological positions associated with online conspiracism, and (iii) how references to shared knowledge contribute to the communicability of conspiracy narratives.",

We present Holistic Evaluation of Language Models (HELM) to improve the transparency of language models. First, we taxonomize the vast space of potential scenarios (i.e. use cases) and metrics (i.e. desiderata) that are of interest for LMs. Then we select a broad subset based on coverage and feasibility, noting what\u2019s missing or underrepresented (e.g. question answering for neglected English dialects, metrics for trustworthiness). Second, we adopt a multi-metric approach: We measure 7 metrics (accuracy, calibration, robustness, fairness, bias, toxicity, and efficiency) for each of 16 core scenarios to the extent possible (87.5% of the time), ensuring that metrics beyond accuracy don\u2019t fall to the wayside, and that trade-offs across models and metrics are clearly exposed. We also perform 7 targeted evaluations, based on 26 targeted scenarios, to more deeply analyze specific aspects (e.g. knowledge, reasoning, memorization/copyright, disinformation). Third, we conduct a large-scale evaluation of 30 prominent language models (spanning open, limited-access, and closed models) on all 42 scenarios, including 21 scenarios that were not previously used in mainstream LM evaluation. Prior to HELM, models on average were evaluated on just 17.9% of the core HELM scenarios, with some prominent models not sharing a single scenario in common. We improve this to 96.0%: now all 30 models have been densely benchmarked on a set of core scenarios and metrics under standardized conditions. Our evaluation surfaces 25 top-level findings concerning the interplay between different scenarios, metrics, and models.

To facilitate this, we utilized the open-sourced large language model LLaMA2 as the backbone for these two modules and efficient finetuning on it.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning agents deployed in the real world often have to cope with partially observable environments. Therefore, most agents employ memory mechanisms to approximate the state of the environment. Recently, there have been impressive success stories in mastering partially observable environments, mostly in the realm of computer games like Dota 2, StarCraft II, or MineCraft. However, existing methods lack interpretability in the sense that it is not comprehensible for humans what the agent stores in its memory. In this regard, we propose a novel memory mechanism that represents past events in human language. Our method uses CLIP to associate visual inputs with language tokens. Then we feed these tokens to a pretrained language model that serves the agent as memory and provides it with a coherent and human-readable representation of the past. We train our memory mechanism on a set of partially observable environments and find that it excels on tasks that require a memory component, while mostly attaining performance on-par with strong baselines on tasks that do not. On a challenging continuous recognition task, where memorizing the past is crucial, our memory mechanism converges two orders of magnitude faster than prior methods. Since our memory mechanism is human-readable, we can peek at an agent's memory and check whether crucial pieces of information have been stored. This significantly enhances troubleshooting and paves the way toward more interpretable agents.",

However, on every one of the 57 tasks, the best models still need substantial improvements before they can reach expert-level accuracy. Models also have lopsided performance and frequently do not know when they are wrong. Worse, they still have nearrandom accuracy on some socially important subjects such as morality and law. By comprehensively evaluating the breadth and depth of a model\u2019s academic and professional understanding, our test can be used to analyze models across many tasks and to identify important shortcomings.",

        "abstract": "The evaluation of Large Language Models (LLMs) is a key element in their continuous improvement process and many benchmarks have been developed to assess the performance of LLMs in different tasks and topics. As LLMs become adopted worldwide, evaluating them in languages other than English is increasingly important. However, most LLM benchmarks are simply translated using an automated tool and then run in the target language. This means that the results depend not only on the LLM performance in that language but also on the quality of the translation. In this paper, we consider the case of the well-known Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) benchmark. Selected categories of the benchmark are translated into Spanish using Azure Translator and ChatGPT4 and run on ChatGPT4. Next, the results are processed to identify the test items that produce different answers in Spanish and English. Those are then analyzed manually to understand if the automatic translation caused the change. The results show that a significant fraction of the failing items can be attributed to mistakes in the translation of the benchmark. These results make a strong case for improving benchmarks in languages other than English by at least revising the translations of the items and preferably by adapting the tests to the target language by experts.",

This framework was applied to python code generation tasks, utilizing the Mostly Basic Python Problems (MBPP) dataset. To facilitate this, we first developed a set of labels to quantify task complexity accurately. Our methodology began with fine-tuning a small language model to predict the likelihood of generating accurate output across different LLMs. It achieved an accuracy of 79% in classifying task complexity, a significant increase from the 34% accuracy observed in the baseline model without fine-tuning. In the following step of allocating tasks, ComplexityNet reduced computational resource usage by 90% when compared to using the most complex model alone, while sustaining a high code generation accuracy of 86.7%. This study demonstrates that fine-tuning smaller models to categorize tasks based on their complexity can lead to a more balanced trade-off between accuracy and efficiency in the use of Large Language Models. Our findings suggest a promising direction for optimizing LLM applications, especially in resource-constrained environments.",

Along with the progress in natural language processing, LLMs have been frequently made accessible to the public to foster deeper investigation and applications. However, when it comes to training datasets for these LLMs, especially the recent state-of-the-art models, they are often not fully disclosed. Creating training data for high-performing LLMs involves extensive cleaning and deduplication to ensure the necessary level of quality. The lack of transparency for training data has thus hampered research on attributing and addressing hallucination and bias issues in LLMs, hindering replication efforts and further advancements in the community. These challenges become even more pronounced in multilingual learning scenarios, where the available multilingual text datasets are often inadequately collected and cleaned. Consequently, there is a lack of open-source and readily usable dataset to effectively train LLMs in multiple languages. To overcome this issue, we present CulturaX, a substantial multilingual dataset with 6.3 trillion tokens in 167 languages, tailored for LLM development. Our dataset undergoes meticulous cleaning and deduplication through a rigorous pipeline of multiple stages to accomplish the best quality for model training, including language identification, URL-based filtering, metric-based cleaning, document refinement, and data deduplication.

        "abstract": "Gravitational-wave detectors are now making it possible to investigate how the merger rate of binary black holes (BBHs) evolves with redshift. In this study, we examine whether the BBH merger rate of isolated binaries deviates from a scaled star formation rate density (SFRD) -- a frequently used model in state-of-the-art research. To address this question, we conduct population synthesis simulations using COMPAS with a grid of stellar evolution models, calculate their cosmological merger rates, and compare them to a scaled SFRD. We find that our simulated rates deviate by factors up to 3.5\u00d7 at z\u223c0 and 5\u00d7 at z\u223c9 due to two main phenomena: (i) The formation efficiency of BBHs is an order of magnitude higher at low metallicities than at solar metallicity; and (ii) BBHs experience a wide range of delays (from a few Myr to many Gyr) between formation and merger. Deviations are similar when comparing to a delayed SFRD, and even larger (up to \u223c10\u00d7) when comparing to SFRD-based models scaled to the local merger rate. Interestingly, our simulations find that the BBH delay time distribution is redshift-dependent, increasing the complexity of the redshift distribution of mergers. We find similar results for simulated merger rates of BHNSs and BNSs. We conclude that the rate of BBH, BHNS, and BNS mergers from the isolated channel can significantly deviate from a scaled SFRD, and that future measurements of the merger rate will provide insights into the formation pathways of gravitational-wave sources.",

Despite their potentially transformative impact, these new capabilities are as yet poorly characterized. In order to inform future research, prepare for disruptive new model capabilities, and ameliorate socially harmful effects, it is vital that we understand the present and near-future capabilities and limitations of language models. To address this challenge, we introduce the Beyond the Imitation Game benchmark (BIG-bench). BIG-bench currently consists of 204 tasks, contributed by 450 authors across 132 institutions. Task topics are diverse, drawing problems from linguistics, childhood development, math, common-sense reasoning, biology, physics, social bias, software development, and beyond. BIG-bench focuses on tasks that are believed to be beyond the capabilities of current language models. We evaluate the behavior of OpenAI's GPT models, Google-internal dense transformer architectures, and Switch-style sparse transformers on BIG-bench, across model sizes spanning millions to hundreds of billions of parameters. In addition, a team of human expert raters performed all tasks in order to provide a strong baseline. Findings include: model performance and calibration both improve with scale, but are poor in absolute terms (and when compared with rater performance); performance is remarkably similar across model classes, though with benefits from sparsity; tasks that improve gradually and predictably commonly involve a large knowledge or memorization component, whereas tasks that exhibit \"breakthrough\" behavior at a critical scale often involve multiple steps or components, or brittle metrics; social bias typically increases with scale in settings with ambiguous context, but this can be improved with prompting.",

        "abstract": "Impressive results have been achieved in natural language processing (NLP) tasks through the training of large language models (LLMs). However, these models occasionally produce toxic content such as insults, threats, and profanity in response to certain prompts, thereby constraining their practical utility. To tackle this issue, various finetuning-based and decoding-based approaches have been utilized to mitigate toxicity. However, these methods typically necessitate additional costs such as high-quality training data or auxiliary models. In this paper, we propose fine-grained detoxification via instance-level prefixes (FGDILP) to mitigate toxic text without additional cost. Specifically, FGDILP contrasts the contextualized representation in attention space using a positive prefix-prepended prompt against multiple negative prefix-prepended prompts at the instance level. This allows for constructing fine-grained subtoxicity vectors, which enables collaborative detoxification by fusing them to correct the normal generation process when provided with a raw prompt. We validate that FGDILP enables controlled text generation with regard to toxicity at both the utterance and context levels. Our method surpasses promptbased baselines in detoxification, although at a slight cost to generation fluency and diversity.",

Natural language queries formed to extract information from a KB entail starting from specific nodes and reasoning over multiple edges of the corresponding KG to arrive at the correct set of answer nodes. Traditional approaches of question answering on KG are based on (a) semantic parsing (SP), where a logical form (e.g., S-expression, SPARQL query, etc.) is generated using node and edge embeddings and then reasoning over these representations or tuning language models to generate the final answer directly, or (b) information-retrieval based that works by extracting entities and relations sequentially. In this work, we evaluate the capability of (LLMs) to answer questions over KG that involve multiple hops. We show that depending upon the size and nature of the KG we need different approaches to extract and feed the relevant information to an LLM since every LLM comes with a fixed context window.

We show that various coreference systems, whether rule-based, feature-rich, or neural, perform significantly worse on the task than humans, who display high inter- annotator agreement. To explain this perfor- mance gap, we show empirically that state-of- the art models often fail to capture context, in- stead relying on the gender or number of can- didate antecedents to make a decision. We then use problem-specific insights to propose a data-augmentation trick called antecedent switching to alleviate this tendency in mod- els.

However, existing RC datasets and tasks are dominated by ques- tions that can be solved by selecting answers using superficial information (e.g., local con- text similarity or global term frequency); they thus fail to test for the essential integrative as- pect of RC. To encourage progress on deeper comprehension of language, we present a new dataset and set of tasks in which the reader must answer questions about stories by reading entire books or movie scripts. These tasks are designed so that successfully answering their questions requires understanding the underly- ing narrative rather than relying on shallow pattern matching or salience. We show that al- though humans solve the tasks easily, standard RC models struggle on the tasks presented here. We provide an analysis of the dataset and the challenges it presents.",

We introduce ComQA, a large dataset of real user questions that exhibit different challenging aspects such as compositionality, temporal reasoning, and comparisons. ComQA questions come from the WikiAnswers community QA platform, which typically contains questions that are not satisfactorily answerable by existing search engine technology. Through a large crowd- sourcing effort, we clean the question dataset, group questions into paraphrase clusters, and annotate clusters with their answers. ComQA contains 11, 214 questions grouped into 4,834 paraphrase clusters. We detail the process of constructing ComQA, including the measures taken to ensure its high quality while mak- ing effective use of crowdsourcing. We also present an extensive analysis of the dataset and the results achieved by state-of-the-art systems on ComQA, demonstrating that our dataset can be a driver of future research on QA.",

        "abstract": "Dialogue State Tracking (DST), a crucial com- ponent of task-oriented dialogue (ToD) sys- tems, keeps track of all important informa- tion pertaining to dialogue history: filling slots with the most probable values throughout the conversation. Existing methods generally rely on a predefined set of values and struggle to generalise to previously unseen slots in new domains. To overcome these challenges, we propose a domain-agnostic extractive question answering (QA) approach with shared weights across domains. To disentangle the complex domain information in ToDs, we train our DST with a novel domain filtering strategy by excluding out-of-domain question samples. With an independent classifier that predicts the presence of multiple domains given the context, our model tackles DST by extract- ing spans in active domains. Empirical results demonstrate that our model can efficiently leverage domain-agnostic QA datasets by two- stage fine-tuning while being both domain- scalable and open-vocabulary in DST. It shows strong transferability by achieving zero-shot domain-adaptation results on MultiWOZ 2.1 with an average JGA of 36.7%. It further achieves cross-lingual transfer with state-of- the-art zero-shot results, 66.2% JGA from En- glish to German and 75.7% JGA from English to Italian on WOZ 2.0.",

Traditional benchmarks, which rely on artificial datasets, may not accurately represent human-level capabilities. In this paper, we introduce AGIEval, a novel benchmark specifically designed to assess foundation model in the context of human-centric standardized exams, such as college entrance exams, law school admission tests, math competitions, and lawyer qualification tests. We evaluate several state-of-the-art foundation models, including GPT-4, ChatGPT, and Text-Davinci-003, using this benchmark. Impressively, GPT-4 surpasses aver- age human performance on SAT, LSAT, and math competitions, attaining a 95% accuracy rate on the SAT Math test and a 92.5% accuracy on the English test of the Chinese national college entrance exam. This demonstrates the extraordi- nary performance of contemporary foundation models. In contrast, we also find that GPT-4 is less proficient in tasks that require complex reasoning or specific domain knowledge. Our comprehensive analyses of model capabilities (understand- ing, knowledge, reasoning, and calculation) reveal these models\u2019 strengths and limitations, providing valuable insights into future directions for enhancing their general capabilities.

        "abstract": "The field of natural language generation has witnessed significant advancements in recent years, including the development of controllable text generation techniques. However, controlling the attributes of the generated text remains a challenge, especially when aiming to avoid undesirable behavior such as toxicity. In this work, we introduce Detoxification Generator (DETOXIGEN), an inference-time algorithm that steers the generation away from unwanted styles. DETOXIGEN is an ensemble of a pre-trained language model (generator) and a detoxifier. The detoxifier is trained intentionally on the toxic data representative of the undesirable attribute, encouraging it to generate text in that style exclusively. During the actual generation, we use the trained detoxifier to produce undesirable tokens for the generator to contrast against at each decoding step. This approach directly informs the generator to avoid generating tokens that the detoxifier considers highly likely. We evaluate DETOXIGEN on the commonly used REALTOXICITYPROMPTS benchmark (Gehman et al., 2020) with various language models as generators. We find that it significantly outperforms previous approaches in detoxification metrics while not compromising on the generation quality. Moreover, the detoxifier is obtained by soft prompt-tuning using the same backbone language model as the generator. Hence, DETOXIGEN requires only a tiny amount of extra weights from the virtual tokens of the detoxifier to be loaded into GPU memory while decoding, making it a promising lightweight, practical, and parameter-efficient detoxification strategy",

We crafted questions that some humans would answer falsely due to a false belief or misconception. To perform well, models must avoid generating false answers learned from imitating human texts. We tested GPT-3, GPT-Neo/J, GPT-2 and a T5-based model. The best model was truthful on 58% of questions, while human performance was 94%. Models generated many false answers that mimic popular misconceptions and have the potential to deceive humans. The largest models were generally the least truthful. This contrasts with other NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size. However, this result is expected if false answers are learned from the training distribution. We suggest that scaling up models alone is less promising for improving truthfulness than fine-tuning using training objectives other than imitation of text from the web.",

With this study we shed light on\n the generic mechanism which produces the coexistence of two different types of\n Gr domains, whose proportion can be carefully controlled by tuning the H2 flow\n rate. For the first time, we show that the growth of Gr using CVD under H2/Ar\n flow rate proceeds in two stages. Firstly, the nucleation of free-standing\n epitaxial graphene on hydrogen (H-Gr) occurs, then H-atoms eventually desorb\n from either step edges or defects. This gives rise, for H2 flow rate below a\n critical value, to the formation of (6x6)Gr domains on 6H-SiC(0001). The front\n of H-desorption progresses proportionally to the reduction of H2. Using a\n robust and generic X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis, we\n realistically quantify the proportions of H-Gr and (6x6)Gr domains of a Gr film\n synthetized in any experimental conditions. Scanning tunnelling microscopy\n supports the XPS measurements.

In order to\n exploit these opportunities we have undertaken a multi-epoch spectroscopic\n survey of the red supergiant dominated young massive clusters thought to be\n present at both near and far ends of the Galactic Bar. Significant\n spectroscopic variability suggestive of radial pulsations was found for the\n yellow supergiant VdBH 222 #505.

In conjunction with extant\n photometry we infer a distance of ~6kpc for VdBH222 and an age of ~20Myr.

Cellular automata (CA) are a well-studied\n approach to exploring the principles underlying self-organization. A CA\n comprises a lattice of cells whose states change over time based on a discrete\n update function. One challenge to developing CA is that the relationship of an\n update function, which describes the local behavior of each cell, to the global\n behavior of the entire CA is often unclear. As a result, many researchers have\n used stochastic search techniques, such as evolutionary algorithms, to\n automatically discover update functions that produce a desired global behavior.\n However, these update functions are typically defined in a way that does not\n provide for self-adaptation. Here we describe an approach to discovering CA\n update functions that are both self-adaptive and self-organizing. Specifically,\n we use a novel evolutionary algorithm-based approach to discover finite state\n machines (FSMs) that implement update functions for CA. We show how this\n approach is able to evolve FSM-based update functions that perform well on the\n density classification task for 1-, 2-, and 3-dimensional CA. Moreover, we show\n that these FSMs are self-adaptive, self-organizing, and highly scalable, often\n performing well on CA that are orders of magnitude larger than those used to\n evaluate performance during the evolutionary search. These results demonstrate\n that CA are a viable platform for studying the integration of self-adaptation\n and self-organization, and strengthen the case for using evolutionary\n algorithms as a component of SASO systems.",

        "abstract": "In this study, we propose a self-supervised video denoising method called\n \"restore-from-restored.\" This method fine-tunes a pre-trained network by using\n a pseudo clean video during the test phase. The pseudo clean video is obtained\n by applying a noisy video to the baseline network. By adopting a fully\n convolutional neural network (FCN) as the baseline, we can improve video\n denoising performance without accurate optical flow estimation and registration\n steps, in contrast to many conventional video restoration methods, due to the\n translation equivariant property of the FCN. Specifically, the proposed method\n can take advantage of plentiful similar patches existing across multiple\n consecutive frames (i.e., patch-recurrence); these patches can boost the\n performance of the baseline network by a large margin. We analyze the\n restoration performance of the fine-tuned video denoising networks with the\n proposed self-supervision-based learning algorithm, and demonstrate that the\n FCN can utilize recurring patches without requiring accurate registration among\n adjacent frames. In our experiments, we apply the proposed method to\n state-of-the-art denoisers and show that our fine-tuned networks achieve a\n considerable improvement in denoising performance.",

        "abstract": "Optical logic gates are fundamental blocks of optical computing to accelerate\n information processing. While significant progress has been achieved in recent\n years, existing implementations typically rely on dedicated structures that are\n predesigned to modulate the phases and intensities of optical beams accurately\n for specific logic functions. Thus, these optical gates usually lack\n reconfigurability and are incapable within or through dynamic complex\n media/environment, such as fog and turbid water. In this work, as a conceptual\n demonstration, we propose reconfigurable optical logic operations through\n scattering media with transmission matrix-based wavefront shaping. A light beam\n is reflected by a spatial light modulator divided into several subregions\n functioning as logic units, with each displayed with predetermined wavefronts\n via transmission matrix-based wavefront shaping. Each modulated wavefront\n transmits through the scattering medium to form a desired light field. The\n interference of these light fields generates bright optical focus at\n pre-assigned locations, representing different logic states. As a proof of\n concept, we experimentally demonstrate five basic logic functions (AND, OR,\n NOT, NAND, NOR). As the transmission matrix of the scattering medium/system can\n be measured instantly to adapt to environment perturbation, the method, if\n further engineered, opens new venues towards reconfigurable optical logic\n computing in a dynamically complex environment.",

We find that, after the onset of mass\n transfer, all the considered systems undergo a strong non-dynamical He-flash.\n However, due to the compactness of these systems, the expanding accretors fill\n their Roche lobe very soon, thus preventing the efficient heating of the\n external layers of the accreted CO WDs. Moreover, due to the loss of matter\n from the systems, the orbital separations enlarge and mass transfer comes to a\n halt. The further evolution depends on the value of $\\dot{M}$, after the donors\n fill again their lobe. On one hand, if the accretion rate, as determined by the\n actual value of (M$_{don}$,M$_{acc}$), is high enough, the accretors experience\n several He-flashes of decreasing strength and then quiescent He-burning sets\n in. Later on, since the mass transfer rate in IDD is a permanently decreasing\n function of time, accretors experience several recurrent strong flashes. On the\n other hand, for intermediate and low values of $\\dot{M}$, the accretors enter\n the strong flashes accretion regime.

We propose a model-based learning\n solution, which consists of two steps. First, we estimate the unknown system\n model from a single system trajectory of finite length, using least squares\n estimation. Next, based on the estimated system model, we design a control\n policy that satisfies the desired information structure. We show that the\n suboptimality gap between our control policy and the optimal decentralized\n control policy (designed using accurate knowledge of the system model) scales\n linearly with the estimation error of the system model. Using this result, we\n provide an end-to-end sample complexity result for learning decentralized\n controllers for a linear quadratic control problem with a partially nested\n information structure.",

Learning logical rules equips a model with strong interpretability as\n well as the ability to generalize to similar tasks.

We attempt to\n definitively discriminate the nature of the RV variations for the young active\n K5 star BD+20 1790, for which visible (VIS) RV measurements show divergent\n results on the existence of a substellar companion. Methods. We compare VIS\n data with high precision RVs in the near infrared (NIR) range by using the\n GIANO - B and IGRINS spectrographs. In addition, we present for the first time\n simultaneous VIS-NIR observations obtained with GIARPS (GIANO - B and HARPS -\n N) at Telescopio Nazionale Galileo (TNG). Orbital RVs are achromatic, so the RV\n amplitude does not change at different wavelengths, while stellar activity\n induces wavelength-dependent RV variations, which are significantly reduced in\n the NIR range with respect to the VIS. Results. The NIR radial velocity\n measurements from GIANO - B and IGRINS show an average amplitude of about one\n quarter with respect to previously published VIS data, as expected when the RV\n jitter is due to stellar activity. Coeval multi-band photometry surprisingly\n shows larger amplitudes in the NIR range, explainable with a mixture of cool\n and hot spots in the same active region. Conclusions. In this work, the claimed\n massive planet around BD+20 1790 is ruled out by our data.

Unlike metro and backbone networks, however, access networks\n directly interface with end-users, so it is important to base the study and\n design of access networks on the behaviors of and the actual performance\n perceived by end-users. In this paper we study the effect of ISP traffic\n shaping using traffic models based on user behaviors and\n application/session-layer metrics providing quantifiable measures of\n user-perceived performance for HTTP, FTP, and streaming video traffic. To\n compare the user-perceived performance of shaped traffic flows with those of\n unshaped ones in an integrated way, we use a multivariate non-inferiority\n testing procedure.

Then we investigate\n their effect at an access level where shaped traffic flows from multiple\n subscribers interact with one another in a common shared access network. The\n simulation results show that for a given token generation rate, a larger token\n bucket provides better user-perceived performance at both subscriber and access\n levels.

        "abstract": "In many bi-manual robotic tasks, like peg-in-a-hole assembly, the success of\n the task execution depends on the error in achieving the desired relative pose\n between the peg and the hole in a pre-insertion configuration. Random actuation\n errors in the joint space usually prevent the two arms from reaching their\n desired task space poses, which in turn results in a random error in relative\n pose between the two hands. This random error varies from trial to trial, and\n thus depending on the tolerance between the peg and the hole, the outcome of\n the assembly task may be random (sometimes the task execution succeeds and\n sometimes it fails). In general, since the relative pose has $6$\n degrees-of-freedom, there are infinite numbers of joint space solutions for the\n two arms that correspond to the same task space relative pose. However, in the\n presence of actuation errors, the joint space solutions are not all identical\n since they map the joint space error sets differently to the task space. Thus,\n the goal of this paper is to develop a methodical approach to compute a joint\n space solution such that the maximum task space error is below a (specified)\n threshold with high probability. Such a solution is called a robust inverse\n kinematics solution for the bi-manual robot. Our proposed method also allows\n the robot to self-evaluate whether it can perform a given bi-manual task\n reliably.

Most existing recommendation methods focus on capturing users'\n personalized preferences through historical user-item interactions, which may\n potentially violate user privacy. Additionally, these approaches often overlook\n the significance of the temporal fluctuation in item popularity that can sway\n users' decision-making. To bridge this gap, we propose Popularity-Aware\n Recommender (PARE), which makes non-personalized recommendations by predicting\n the items that will attain the highest popularity. PARE consists of four\n modules, each focusing on a different aspect: popularity history, temporal\n impact, periodic impact, and side information. Finally, an attention layer is\n leveraged to fuse the outputs of four modules. To our knowledge, this is the\n first work to explicitly model item popularity in recommendation systems.\n Extensive experiments show that PARE performs on par or even better than\n sophisticated state-of-the-art recommendation methods. Since PARE prioritizes\n item popularity over personalized user preferences, it can enhance existing\n recommendation methods as a complementary component. Our experiments\n demonstrate that integrating PARE with existing recommendation methods\n significantly surpasses the performance of standalone models, highlighting\n PARE's potential as a complement to existing recommendation methods.\n Furthermore, the simplicity of PARE makes it immensely practical for industrial\n applications and a valuable baseline for future research.",

In this study, we delve into the impact of nuclear\n quantum motion, or vibrational mode quantization, on the structural and elastic\n properties of 3C-SiC. This aspect, elusive in conventional {\\it ab-initio}\n calculations, is explored through path-integral molecular dynamics (PIMD)\n simulations using an efficient tight-binding (TB) Hamiltonian. This\n investigation spans a wide range of temperatures and pressures, including\n tensile stress, adeptly addressing the quantization and anharmonicity inherent\n in solid-state vibrational modes. The accuracy of the TB model has been checked\n by comparison with density-functional-theory calculations at zero temperature.\n The magnitude of quantum effects is assessed by comparing PIMD outcomes with\n results obtained from classical molecular dynamics simulations. Our\n investigation uncovers notable reductions of 5%, 10%, and 4% in the elastic\n constants $C_{11}$, $C_{12}$, and $C_{44}$, respectively, attributed to atomic\n zero-point oscillations. Consequently, the bulk modulus and Poisson's ratio of\n 3C-SiC exhibit reduced values by 7% and 5% at low temperature.

Existing literature commonly assumes the existence of a single\n entity, the social planner, as a powerful decision maker who manages all\n resources. However, this is often not the case in practice. Instead of making\n this assumption, we specifically examine the innate noncooperative nature of\n two different entities involved in the planning problem.

To address the\n strategic interaction between entities, a bilevel mixed integer program is\n formulated, with the CSP and FO problems expressed in the upper and lower\n levels respectively, in a joint decision making process.

In this work, we consider efficient\n construction of composable core-sets for the determinant maximization problem.\n This can also be cast as the MAP inference task for determinantal point\n processes, that have recently gained a lot of interest for modeling diversity\n and fairness. The problem was recently studied in [IMOR'18], where they\n designed composable core-sets with the optimal approximation bound of $\\tilde\n O(k)^k$. On the other hand, the more practical Greedy algorithm has been\n previously used in similar contexts. In this work, first we provide a\n theoretical approximation guarantee of $O(C^{k^2})$ for the Greedy algorithm in\n the context of composable core-sets; Further, we propose to use a Local Search\n based algorithm that while being still practical, achieves a nearly optimal\n approximation bound of $O(k)^{2k}$; Finally, we implement all three algorithms\n and show the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on standard data sets.",

These models\n are very useful in causal problems because the outcome process is often complex\n and difficult to model, and there may only be information available about the\n treatment process (at best). Semiparametric theory gives a framework for\n benchmarking efficiency and constructing estimators in such settings. In the\n second part of the paper we discuss empirical process theory, which provides\n powerful tools for understanding the asymptotic behavior of semiparametric\n estimators that depend on flexible nonparametric estimators of nuisance\n functions. These tools are crucial for incorporating machine learning and other\n modern methods into causal inference analyses. We conclude by examining related\n extensions and future directions for work in semiparametric causal inference.",

        "abstract": "Toward the goal of automatic production for sports broadcasts, a paramount\n task consists in understanding the high-level semantic information of the game\n in play. For instance, recognizing and localizing the main actions of the game\n would allow producers to adapt and automatize the broadcast production,\n focusing on the important details of the game and maximizing the spectator\n engagement. In this paper, we focus our analysis on action spotting in soccer\n broadcast, which consists in temporally localizing the main actions in a soccer\n game. To that end, we propose a novel feature pooling method based on NetVLAD,\n dubbed NetVLAD++, that embeds temporally-aware knowledge. Different from\n previous pooling methods that consider the temporal context as a single set to\n pool from, we split the context before and after an action occurs. We argue\n that considering the contextual information around the action spot as a single\n entity leads to a sub-optimal learning for the pooling module. With NetVLAD++,\n we disentangle the context from the past and future frames and learn specific\n vocabularies of semantics for each subsets, avoiding to blend and blur such\n vocabulary in time. Injecting such prior knowledge creates more informative\n pooling modules and more discriminative pooled features, leading into a better\n understanding of the actions. We train and evaluate our methodology on the\n recent large-scale dataset SoccerNet-v2, reaching 53.4% Average-mAP for action\n spotting, a +12.7% improvement w.r.t the current state-of-the-art.",

In this Letter, we point out a\n possibility in which higher-loop processes qualitatively change the picture\n through UV-IR mixing, in which the size of the FS enters as a relevant scale.\n The UV-IR mixing effect enhances the coupling at low energies, such that the\n basin of attraction for the weakly coupled fixed point of a $(2+1)$-dimensional\n MFL shrinks to a measure-zero set in the low-energy limit. This UV-IR mixing is\n caused by gapless virtual Cooper pairs that spread over the entire FS through\n marginal long-range interactions. Our finding signals a possible breakdown of\n the patch description for the MFL and questions the validity of using the MFL\n as the base theory in a controlled scheme for non-Fermi liquids that arise from\n relevant long-range interactions.",

The general aim was to obtain new representa- tions integrating complementary knowledge from different source pre-trained embeddings thereby improving their overall quality. How- ever, previous meta-embeddings have been evaluated using a variety of methods and datasets, which makes it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions regarding the merits of each approach. In this paper we propose a unified common framework, including both intrinsic and extrinsic tasks, for a fair and objective meta-embeddings evaluation. Fur- thermore, we present a new method to gen- erate meta-embeddings, outperforming previ- ous work on a large number of intrinsic evalu- ation benchmarks. Our evaluation framework also allows us to conclude that previous extrin- sic evaluations of meta-embeddings have been overestimated.",

        "abstract": "A recurring challenge of crowdsourcing NLP datasets at scale is that human writers often rely on repetitive patterns when crafting ex- amples, leading to a lack of linguistic diver- sity. We introduce a novel approach for dataset creation based on worker and AI collabo- ration, which brings together the generative strength of language models and the evaluative strength of humans. Starting with an existing dataset, MultiNLI for natural language infer- ence (NLI), our approach uses dataset cartog- raphy to automatically identify examples that demonstrate challenging reasoning patterns, and instructs GPT-3 to compose new exam- ples with similar patterns. Machine generated examples are then automatically filtered, and finally revised and labeled by human crowd- workers. The resulting dataset, WANLI, con- sists of 107,885 NLI examples and presents unique empirical strengths over existing NLI datasets. Remarkably, training a model on WANLI improves performance on eight out- of-domain test sets we consider, including by 11% on HANS and 9% on Adversarial NLI, compared to training on the 4\u00d7 larger MultiNLI. Moreover, it continues to be more effective than MultiNLI augmented with other NLI datasets. Our results demonstrate the promise of leveraging natural language gener- ation techniques and re-imagining the role of humans in the dataset creation process.",

        "abstract": "Robustness evaluation against adversarial examples has become increasingly im- portant to unveil the trustworthiness of the prevailing deep models in natural lan- guage processing (NLP). However, in contrast to the computer vision (CV) do- main where the first-order projected gradient descent (PGD) is used as the bench- mark approach to generate adversarial examples for robustness evaluation, there lacks a principled first-order gradient-based robustness evaluation framework in NLP. The emerging optimization challenges lie in 1) the discrete nature of textual inputs together with the strong coupling between the perturbation location and the actual content, and 2) the additional constraint that the perturbed text should be fluent and achieve a low perplexity under a language model. These challenges make the development of PGD-like NLP attacks difficult. To bridge the gap, we propose TEXTGRAD, a new attack generator using gradient-driven optimization, supporting high-accuracy and high-quality assessment of adversarial robustness in NLP. Specifically, we address the aforementioned challenges in a unified opti- mization framework. And we develop an effective convex relaxation method to co-optimize the continuously-relaxed site selection and perturbation variables, and leverage an effective sampling method to establish an accurate mapping from the continuous optimization variables to the discrete textual perturbations. Moreover, as a first-order attack generation method, TEXTGRAD can be baked in adversarial training to further improve the robustness of NLP models. Extensive experiments are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of TEXTGRAD not only in attack generation for robustness evaluation but also in adversarial defense. From the at- tack perspective, we show that TEXTGRAD achieves remarkable improvements in both the attack success rate and the perplexity score over five state-of-the-art baselines. From the defense perspective, TEXTGRAD-enabled adversarial train- ing yields the most robust NLP model against a wide spectrum of NLP attacks.",

        "abstract": "Instruction tuning enables language models to more effectively generalize and better follow user intent. However, obtaining instruction data is costly and challenging. Prior work em- ploys methods such as expensive human an- notation, crowd-sourced datasets with align- ment issues, and generating noisy examples via LLMs. We introduce the LongForm-C dataset, which is created by reverse instruc- tions. We generate instructions via LLMs for human-written corpus examples using re- verse instructions. First we select a diverse set of human-written documents from corpora such as C4 and Wikipedia; then we generate instructions for these documents via LLMs. This approach provides a cheaper and cleaner instruction-tuning dataset with natural output and one suitable for long text generation. Our models outperform 10x larger language mod- els without instruction tuning on tasks such as story/recipe generation and long-form ques- tion answering. Moreover, LongForm mod- els outperform prior instruction-tuned models such as FLAN-T5 and Alpaca by a large mar- gin, and improve language understanding capa- bilities further. Finally, our models can effec- tively follow and answer multilingual instruc-\ntions; we demonstrate this for news genera-\ntion.

All questions are designed to probe both causal and masked language models in a zero-shot setting. We conduct an extensive analysis which demon- strates that state-of-the-art pretrained models are inadequate at physical reasoning: they are influenced by the order in which answer op- tions are presented to them, they struggle when the superlative in a question is inverted (e.g., most \u2194 least), and increasing the amount of pretraining data and parameters only yields minimal improvements. These results provide support for the hypothesis that current pre- trained models\u2019 ability to reason about physi- cal interactions is inherently limited by a lack of real world experience. By highlighting these limitations, we hope to motivate the de- velopment of models with a human-like under- standing of the physical world.",

Question Answering systems that can answer those questions can make consumption of the content much more efficient. However, building such tools requires data that reflect the difficulty of the task arising from complex reasoning about claims made in multiple parts of a paper. In contrast, existing information- seeking question answering datasets usually contain questions about generic factoid-type information. We therefore present QASPER, a dataset of 5,049 questions over 1,585 Natu- ral Language Processing papers. Each ques- tion is written by an NLP practitioner who read only the title and abstract of the corre- sponding paper, and the question seeks infor- mation present in the full text. The questions are then answered by a separate set of NLP practitioners who also provide supporting ev- idence to answers. We find that existing mod- els that do well on other QA tasks do not per- form well on answering these questions, un- derperforming humans by at least 27 F1 points when answering them from entire papers, moti- vating further research in document-grounded, information-seeking QA, which our dataset is designed to facilitate.",

First, we design a language query vision module to obtain the response of language description in image areas, thus aligning the visual and linguistic representations across modalities. Then, a vision query language module utilizes the correlation between visual and linguistic modalities to filter the product title and effectively suppress the content irrelevant to the vision in the title. To promote the research in this field, we also construct a Multi-Modal Product Segmentation dataset (MMPS), which contains 30,000 images and corresponding titles.

        "abstract": "While self-supervised learning has made rapid advances in natural language processing, it remains unclear when researchers should engage in resource-intensive domain-specific pretraining (domain pretraining). The law, puzzlingly, has yielded few documented in- stances of substantial gains to domain pretraining in spite of the fact that legal language is widely seen to be unique. We hypothesize that these existing results stem from the fact that existing legal NLP tasks are too easy and fail to meet conditions for when domain pretraining can help. To address this, we first present CaseHOLD (Case Holdings On Legal Decisions), a new dataset comprised of over 53,000+ multiple choice questions to identify the relevant holding of a cited case. This dataset presents a fundamental task to lawyers and is both legally meaningful and difficult from an NLP perspective (F1 of 0.4 with a BiLSTM baseline). Second, we assess performance gains on CaseHOLD and existing legal NLP datasets. While a Transformer architecture (BERT) pretrained on a general corpus (Google Books and Wikipedia) improves perfor- mance, domain pretraining (on a corpus of \u22483.5M decisions across all courts in the U.S. that is larger than BERT\u2019s) with a custom legal vocabulary exhibits the most substantial performance gains with CaseHOLD (gain of 7.2% on F1, representing a 12% improvement on BERT) and consistent performance gains across two other legal tasks. Third, we show that domain pretraining may be warranted when the task exhibits sufficient similarity to the pretraining corpus: the level of performance increase in three legal tasks was directly tied to the domain specificity of the task. Our findings inform when researchers should engage in resource-intensive pretraining and show that Transformer-based architectures, too, learn embeddings suggestive of distinct legal language.",

        "abstract": "\nSimulated humanoids are an appealing research domain due to their physical capabilities. Nonetheless, they are also challenging to control, as a policy must drive an unstable, discontinuous, and high-dimensional physical system. One widely studied approach is to utilize motion capture (MoCap) data to teach the humanoid agent low-level skills (e.g., standing, walking, and running) that can then be re-used to synthesize high-level behaviors. However, even with MoCap data, controlling simulated humanoids remains very hard, as MoCap data offers only kinematic information. Finding physical control inputs to realize the demonstrated motions requires computationally intensive methods like reinforcement learning. Thus, despite the publicly available MoCap data, its utility has been limited to institutions with large-scale compute. In this work, we dramatically lower the barrier for productive research on this topic by training and releasing high-quality agents that can track over three hours of MoCap data for a simulated humanoid in the dm_control physics-based environment. We release MoCapAct (Motion Capture with Actions), a dataset of these expert agents and their rollouts, which contain proprioceptive observations and actions. We demonstrate the utility of MoCapAct by using it to train a single hierarchical policy capable of tracking the entire MoCap dataset within dm_control and show the learned low-level component can be re-used to efficiently learn downstream high-level tasks. Finally, we use MoCapAct to train an autoregressive GPT model and show that it can control a simulated humanoid to perform natural motion completion given a motion prompt.

        "abstract": "We introduce a synthetic dataset called Sentences Involving Complex Compositional Knowledge (SICCK) and a novel analysis that investigates the performance of Natural Lan- guage Inference (NLI) models to understand compositionality in logic. We produce 1,304 sentence pairs by modifying 15 examples from the SICK dataset (Marelli et al., 2014). To this end, we modify the original texts using a set of phrases \u2013 modifiers that correspond to uni- versal quantifiers, existential quantifiers, nega- tion, and other concept modifiers in Natural Logic (NL) (MacCartney, 2009). We use these phrases to modify the subject, verb, and object parts of the premise and hypothesis. Lastly, we annotate these modified texts with the corre- sponding entailment labels following NL rules. We conduct a preliminary verification of how well the change in the structural and semantic composition is captured by neural NLI models, in both zero-shot and fine-tuned scenarios. We found that the performance of NLI models un- der the zero-shot setting is poor, especially for modified sentences with negation and existen- tial quantifiers. After fine-tuning this dataset, we observe that models continue to perform poorly over negation, existential and universal modifiers.",

        "abstract": "Large crowdsourced datasets are widely used for training and evaluating neural models on natural language inference (NLI). Despite these efforts, neural models have a hard time capturing logical inferences, including those licensed by phrase replacements, so- called monotonicity reasoning. Since no large dataset has been developed for monotonicity reasoning, it is still unclear whether the main obstacle is the size of datasets or the model ar- chitectures themselves. To investigate this is- sue, we introduce a new dataset, called HELP, for handling entailments with lexical and logi- cal phenomena. We add it to training data for the state-of-the-art neural models and evaluate them on test sets for monotonicity phenomena. The results showed that our data augmentation improved the overall accuracy. We also find that the improvement is better on monotonic- ity inferences with lexical replacements than on downward inferences with disjunction and modification. This suggests that some types of inferences can be improved by our data aug- mentation while others are immune to it.",

We propose a hybrid reasoning system to integrate these three tasks and achieve impressive overall performance on the LSAT tests. The experimental results demonstrate that our system endows itself a certain complex reasoning ability, especially the fundamental reading comprehension and challenging logical reasoning capacities. Further analysis also shows the effectiveness of combining the pre-trained models with the task-specific rea- soning module, and integrating symbolic knowledge into discrete interpretable reasoning steps in complex reasoning.

Our goal is to enable zero-shot task adaptation of large language models on users\u2019 specialized, private data. We train Bonito on a new large-scale dataset with 1.65M examples created by remixing existing instruction tuning datasets into meta-templates. The meta-templates for a dataset produce training examples where the input is the unannotated text and the task attribute and the output consists of the instruction and the response. We use Bonito to generate synthetic tasks for seven datasets from specialized domains across three task types\u2014yes-no question answering, extractive question answering, and natural language inference\u2014and adapt language models. We show that Bonito significantly improves the average performance of pretrained and instruction tuned models over the de facto self supervised baseline. For example, adapting Mistral-Instruct-v2 and instruction tuned variants of Mistral and Llama2 with Bonito improves the strong zero-shot performance by 22.1 F1 points whereas the next word prediction objective undoes some of the benefits of instruction tuning and reduces the average performance by 0.8 F1 points. We conduct additional experiments with Bonito to understand the effects of the domain, the size of the training set, and the choice of alternative synthetic task generators. Overall, we show that learning with synthetic instruction tuning datasets is an effective way to adapt language models to new domains.

To address the issues, this study proposes a disease labeler tailored for the generation of Chinese chest X-ray reports.

Do such models know that they are LLMs and reliably act on this knowledge? Are they aware of their current circumstances, such as being deployed to the public? We refer to a model's knowledge of itself and its circumstances as situational awareness. To quantify situational awareness in LLMs, we introduce a range of behavioral tests, based on question answering and instruction following. These tests form the Situational Awareness Dataset (SAD), a benchmark comprising 7 task categories and over 13,000 questions. The benchmark tests numerous abilities, including the capacity of LLMs to (i) recognize their own generated text, (ii) predict their own behavior, (iii) determine whether a prompt is from internal evaluation or real-world deployment, and (iv) follow instructions that depend on self-knowledge.\nWe evaluate 16 LLMs on SAD, including both base (pretrained) and chat models. While all models perform better than chance, even the highest-scoring model (Claude 3 Opus) is far from a human baseline on certain tasks. We also observe that performance on SAD is only partially predicted by metrics of general knowledge (e.g. MMLU). Chat models, which are finetuned to serve as AI assistants, outperform their corresponding base models on SAD but not on general knowledge tasks. The purpose of SAD is to facilitate scientific understanding of situational awareness in LLMs by breaking it down into quantitative abilities. Situational awareness is important because it enhances a model's capacity for autonomous planning and action. While this has potential benefits for automation, it also introduces novel risks related to AI safety and control. Code and latest results available at this https URL .",

        "title": "Efficient Materials Informatics between Rockets and Electrons",
        "abstract": "The true power of computational research typically can lay in either what it accomplishes or what it enables others to accomplish. In this work, both avenues are simultaneously embraced across several distinct efforts existing at three general scales of abstractions of what a material is - atomistic, physical, and design. At each, an efficient materials informatics infrastructure is being built from the ground up based on (1) the fundamental understanding of the underlying prior knowledge, including the data, (2) deployment routes that take advantage of it, and (3) pathways to extend it in an autonomous or semi-autonomous fashion, while heavily relying on artificial intelligence (AI) to guide well-established DFT-based ab initio and CALPHAD-based thermodynamic methods.\nThe resulting multi-level discovery infrastructure is highly generalizable as it focuses on encoding problems to solve them easily rather than looking for an existing solution. To showcase it, this dissertation discusses the design of multi-alloy functionally graded materials (FGMs) incorporating ultra-high temperature refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) towards gas turbine and jet engine efficiency increase reducing CO2 emissions, as well as hypersonic vehicles. It leverages a new graph representation of underlying mathematical space using a newly developed algorithm based on combinatorics, not subject to many problems troubling the community. Underneath, property models and phase relations are learned from optimized samplings of the largest and highest quality dataset of HEA in the world, called ULTERA. At the atomistic level, a data ecosystem optimized for machine learning (ML) from over 4.5 million relaxed structures, called MPDD, is used to inform experimental observations and improve thermodynamic models by providing stability data enabled by a new efficient featurization framework.",

        "title": "TongGu: Mastering Classical Chinese Understanding with Knowledge-Grounded Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Classical Chinese is a gateway to the rich heritage and wisdom of ancient China, yet its complexities pose formidable comprehension barriers for most modern people without specialized knowledge. While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in Natural Language Processing (NLP), they struggle with Classical Chinese Understanding (CCU), especially in data-demanding and knowledge-intensive tasks. In response to this dilemma, we propose \\textbf{TongGu} (mean understanding ancient and modern), the first CCU-specific LLM, underpinned by three core contributions. First, we construct a two-stage instruction-tuning dataset ACCN-INS derived from rich classical Chinese corpora, aiming to unlock the full CCU potential of LLMs. Second, we propose Redundancy-Aware Tuning (RAT) to prevent catastrophic forgetting, enabling TongGu to acquire new capabilities while preserving its foundational knowledge. Third, we present a CCU Retrieval-Augmented Generation (CCU-RAG) technique to reduce hallucinations based on knowledge-grounding. Extensive experiments across 24 diverse CCU tasks validate TongGu's superior ability, underscoring the effectiveness of RAT and CCU-RAG. The model and dataset will be public available.",

        "title": "Are Large Language Models Consistent over Value-laden Questions?",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) appear to bias their survey answers toward certain values. Nonetheless, some argue that LLMs are too inconsistent to simulate particular values. Are they? To answer, we first define value consistency as the similarity of answers across (1) paraphrases of one question, (2) related questions under one topic, (3) multiple-choice and open-ended use-cases of one question, and (4) multilingual translations of a question to English, Chinese, German, and Japanese. We apply these measures to a few large (>=34b), open LLMs including llama-3, as well as gpt-4o, using eight thousand questions spanning more than 300 topics. Unlike prior work, we find that models are relatively consistent across paraphrases, use-cases, translations, and within a topic. Still, some inconsistencies remain. Models are more consistent on uncontroversial topics (e.g., in the U.S., \"Thanksgiving\") than on controversial ones (\"euthanasia\"). Base models are both more consistent compared to fine-tuned models and are uniform in their consistency across topics, while fine-tuned models are more inconsistent about some topics (\"euthanasia\") than others (\"women's rights\") like our human subjects (n=165).",

        "title": "RLHF Can Speak Many Languages: Unlocking Multilingual Preference Optimization for LLMs",
        "abstract": "Preference optimization techniques have become a standard final stage for training state-of-art large language models (LLMs). However, despite widespread adoption, the vast majority of work to-date has focused on first-class citizen languages like English and Chinese. This captures a small fraction of the languages in the world, but also makes it unclear which aspects of current state-of-the-art research transfer to a multilingual setting. In this work, we perform an exhaustive study to achieve a new state-of-the-art in aligning multilingual LLMs. We introduce a novel, scalable method for generating high-quality multilingual feedback data to balance data coverage. We establish the benefits of cross-lingual transfer and increased dataset size in preference training. Our preference-trained model achieves a 54.4% win-rate against Aya 23 8B, the current state-of-the-art multilingual LLM in its parameter class, and a 69.5% win-rate or higher against widely used models like Gemma-1.1-7B-it, Llama-3-8B-Instruct, Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.3. As a result of our study, we expand the frontier of alignment techniques to 23 languages covering half of the world's population.",

        "title": "CFinBench: A Comprehensive Chinese Financial Benchmark for Large Language Models",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable performance on various NLP tasks, yet their potential in more challenging and domain-specific task, such as finance, has not been fully explored. In this paper, we present CFinBench: a meticulously crafted, the most comprehensive evaluation benchmark to date, for assessing the financial knowledge of LLMs under Chinese context. In practice, to better align with the career trajectory of Chinese financial practitioners, we build a systematic evaluation from 4 first-level categories: (1) Financial Subject: whether LLMs can memorize the necessary basic knowledge of financial subjects, such as economics, statistics and auditing. (2) Financial Qualification: whether LLMs can obtain the needed financial qualified certifications, such as certified public accountant, securities qualification and banking qualification. (3) Financial Practice: whether LLMs can fulfill the practical financial jobs, such as tax consultant, junior accountant and securities analyst. (4) Financial Law: whether LLMs can meet the requirement of financial laws and regulations, such as tax law, insurance law and economic law. CFinBench comprises 99,100 questions spanning 43 second-level categories with 3 question types: single-choice, multiple-choice and judgment. We conduct extensive experiments of 50 representative LLMs with various model size on CFinBench. The results show that GPT4 and some Chinese-oriented models lead the benchmark, with the highest average accuracy being 60.16%, highlighting the challenge presented by CFinBench.
