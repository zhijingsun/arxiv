        "abstract": "Powered by the emerging large language models (LLMs), autonomous geographic information systems (GIS) agents have the potential to accomplish spatial analyses and cartographic tasks. However, a research gap exists to support fully autonomous GIS agents: how to enable agents to discover and download the necessary data for geospatial analyses. This study proposes LLM-Find, an autonomous GIS agent framework capable of selecting and fetching required geospatial data by generating, executing, and debugging programs. LLM-Find utilizes the LLM as the decision-maker, selects the appropriate data source (s) from a pre-defined source list, and fetches the data from the chosen source. Each data source has a handbook that records the metadata and technical details for data retrieval. The proposed framework is designed in a plug-and-play style to ensure flexibility and extensibility. Human users or autonomous data scrawlers can add a new data source by adding a new handbook. We developed a prototype agent based on LLM-Find, and experiment results demonstrate its capability of retrieving data from various sources including OpenStreetMap, administrative boundaries and demographic data from the US Census Bureau, satellite basemaps from ESRI World Imagery, weather data from a commercial provider, and the COVID-19 data from the NYTimes GitHub. Our study is among the first attempts to develop an autonomous geospatial data retrieval agent.",

        "title": "A Comprehensive Survey on Retrieval Methods in Recommender Systems",
        "abstract": "In an era dominated by information overload, effective recommender systems are essential for managing the deluge of data across digital platforms. Multi-stage cascade ranking systems are widely used in the industry, with retrieval and ranking being two typical stages. Retrieval methods sift through vast candidates to filter out irrelevant items, while ranking methods prioritize these candidates to present the most relevant items to users. Unlike studies focusing on the ranking stage, this survey explores the critical yet often overlooked retrieval stage of recommender systems. To achieve precise and efficient personalized retrieval, we summarize existing work in three key areas: improving similarity computation between user and item, enhancing indexing mechanisms for efficient retrieval, and optimizing training methods of retrieval. We also provide a comprehensive set of benchmarking experiments on three public datasets. Furthermore, we highlight current industrial applications through a case study on retrieval practices at a specific company, covering the entire retrieval process and online serving, along with practical implications and challenges. By detailing the retrieval stage, which is fundamental for effective recommendation, this survey aims to bridge the existing knowledge gap and serve as a cornerstone for researchers interested in optimizing this critical component of cascade recommender systems.",

How to utilize ToD accurately, efficiently and effectively for information gathering has always been a critical and challenging task.

However, current datasets primarily cater to user-led systems and are limited to predefined specific scenarios and slots, thereby necessitating improvements in the proactiveness, diversity, and capabilities of TOD. In this study, we present a detailed multi-domain task-oriented data construction process for conversations, and a Chinese dialogue dataset generated based on this process, \\textbf{TransferTOD}, which authentically simulates human-machine dialogues in 30 popular life service scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we trained a \\textbf{TransferTOD-7B} model using full-parameter fine-tuning, showcasing notable abilities in slot filling and questioning.

        "abstract": "Audio-visual semantic segmentation (AVSS) aims to segment and classify sounding objects in videos with acoustic cues. However, most approaches operate on the close-set assumption and only identify pre-defined categories from training data, lacking the generalization ability to detect novel categories in practical applications. In this paper, we introduce a new task: open-vocabulary audio-visual semantic segmentation, extending AVSS task to open-world scenarios beyond the annotated label space. This is a more challenging task that requires recognizing all categories, even those that have never been seen nor heard during training. Moreover, we propose the first open-vocabulary AVSS framework, OV-AVSS, which mainly consists of two parts: 1) a universal sound source localization module to perform audio-visual fusion and locate all potential sounding objects and 2) an open-vocabulary classification module to predict categories with the help of the prior knowledge from large-scale pre-trained vision-language models. To properly evaluate the open-vocabulary AVSS, we split zero-shot training and testing subsets based on the AVSBench-semantic benchmark, namely AVSBench-OV. Extensive experiments demonstrate the strong segmentation and zero-shot generalization ability of our model on all categories. On the AVSBench-OV dataset, OV-AVSS achieves 55.43% mIoU on base categories and 29.14% mIoU on novel categories, exceeding the state-of-the-art zero-shot method by 41.88%/20.61% and open-vocabulary method by 10.2%/11.6%.

In this work, we address several challenges for post-hoc hallucination detection in production settings. Our pipeline for hallucination detection entails: first, producing a confidence score representing the likelihood that a generated answer is a hallucination; second, calibrating the score conditional on attributes of the inputs and candidate response; finally, performing detection by thresholding the calibrated score. We benchmark a variety of state-of-the-art scoring methods on different datasets, encompassing question answering, fact checking, and summarization tasks. We employ diverse LLMs to ensure a comprehensive assessment of performance. We show that calibrating individual scoring methods is critical for ensuring risk-aware downstream decision making. Based on findings that no individual score performs best in all situations, we propose a multi-scoring framework, which combines different scores and achieves top performance across all datasets. We further introduce cost-effective multi-scoring, which can match or even outperform more expensive detection methods, while significantly reducing computational overhead.",

First, we propose a prompt refinement module to implicitly perceive the potential targets, and output the offsets to directly transform the low-quality box prompt into a high-quality one. We then provide an online iterative strategy for further prompt refinement. Second, we introduce a prompt enhancement module to automatically generate point prompts to assist the box-promptable segmentation effectively. Last, we build a self-information extractor to encode the prior information from the input image. These features can optimize the image embeddings and attention calculation, thus, the robustness of SAM can be further enhanced. Extensive experiments on the large medical segmentation dataset including 99,299 images, 5 modalities, and 25 organs/targets validated the efficacy of our proposed RoBox-SAM.",

Materials and Methods: We used a DenseNet121 model pretrained MIMIC-CXR dataset for deep learning-based multilabel classification using ground truth labels from radiology reports extracted using the CheXpert and CheXbert Labeler. We compared the performance of the 14 chest X-ray labels on the MIMIC-CXR and Veterans Healthcare Administration chest X-ray dataset (VA-CXR). The VA-CXR dataset comprises over 259k chest X-ray images spanning between the years 2010 and 2022. Results: The validation of ground truth and the assessment of multi-label classification performance across various NLP extraction tools revealed that the VA-CXR dataset exhibited lower disagreement rates than the MIMIC-CXR datasets. Additionally, there were notable differences in AUC scores between models utilizing CheXpert and CheXbert. When evaluating multi-label classification performance across different datasets, minimal domain shift was observed in unseen datasets, except for the label \"Enlarged Cardiomediastinum.\" The study year's subgroup analyses exhibited the most significant variations in multi-label classification model performance. These findings underscore the importance of considering domain shifts in chest X-ray classification tasks, particularly concerning study years. Conclusion: Our study reveals the significant impact of domain shift and demographic factors on chest X-ray classification, emphasizing the need for improved transfer learning and equitable model development.

Empathy can be categorized into cognitive empathy and affective empathy. The former pertains to the ability to understand and discern the emotional issues and situations of others, while the latter involves the capacity to provide comfort. To enhance one's empathetic abilities, it is essential to develop both these aspects. Therefore, we develop an innovative framework that combines retrieval augmentation and emotional support strategy integration.

We evaluated four recent LLMs on their performance directly in the Sinhala language, and by translation to and from English.

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) are extensively used, there are raising concerns regarding privacy, security, and copyright due to their opaque training data, which brings the problem of detecting pre-training data on the table. Current solutions to this problem leverage techniques explored in machine learning privacy such as Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), which heavily depend on LLMs' capability of verbatim memorization. However, this reliance presents challenges, especially given the vast amount of training data and the restricted number of effective training epochs. In this paper, we propose an adaptive pre-training data detection method which alleviates this reliance and effectively amplify the identification. Our method adaptively locates \\textit{surprising tokens} of the input. A token is surprising to a LLM if the prediction on the token is \"certain but wrong\", which refers to low Shannon entropy of the probability distribution and low probability of the ground truth token at the same time. By using the prediction probability of surprising tokens to measure \\textit{surprising}, the detection method is achieved based on the simple hypothesis that seeing seen data is less surprising for the model compared with seeing unseen data. The method can be applied without any access to the the pre-training data corpus or additional training like reference models. Our approach exhibits a consistent enhancement compared to existing methods in diverse experiments conducted on various benchmarks and models, achieving a maximum improvement of 29.5\\%. We also introduce a new benchmark Dolma-Book developed upon a novel framework, which employs book data collected both before and after model training to provide further evaluation.",

        "abstract": "Real-world navigation often involves dealing with unexpected obstructions such as closed doors, moved objects, and unpredictable entities. However, mainstream Vision-and-Language Navigation (VLN) tasks typically assume instructions perfectly align with the fixed and predefined navigation graphs without any obstructions. This assumption overlooks potential discrepancies in actual navigation graphs and given instructions, which can cause major failures for both indoor and outdoor agents. To address this issue, we integrate diverse obstructions into the R2R dataset by modifying both the navigation graphs and visual observations, introducing an innovative dataset and task, R2R with UNexpected Obstructions (R2R-UNO). R2R-UNO contains various types and numbers of path obstructions to generate instruction-reality mismatches for VLN research. Experiments on R2R-UNO reveal that state-of-the-art VLN methods inevitably encounter significant challenges when facing such mismatches, indicating that they rigidly follow instructions rather than navigate adaptively. Therefore, we propose a novel method called ObVLN (Obstructed VLN), which includes a curriculum training strategy and virtual graph construction to help agents effectively adapt to obstructed environments. Empirical results show that ObVLN not only maintains robust performance in unobstructed scenarios but also achieves a substantial performance advantage with unexpected obstructions.",

Guided by CLIP, which is pre-trained on RGB images, existing approaches achieve zero-shot object recognition by maximizing embedding similarities between event data encoded by an event encoder and RGB images encoded by the CLIP image encoder. Alternatively, several methods learn RGB frame reconstructions from event data for the CLIP image encoder. However, these approaches often result in suboptimal zero-shot performance.\n  This study develops an event encoder without relying on additional reconstruction networks. We theoretically analyze the performance bottlenecks of previous approaches: global similarity-based objective (i.e., maximizing the embedding similarities) cause semantic misalignments between the learned event embedding space and the CLIP text embedding space due to the degree of freedom. To mitigate the issue, we explore a scalar-wise regularization strategy. Furthermore, to scale up the number of events and RGB data pairs for training, we also propose a pipeline for synthesizing event data from static RGB images.\n  Experimentally, our data synthesis strategy exhibits an attractive scaling property, and our method achieves superior zero-shot object recognition performance on extensive standard benchmark datasets, even compared with past supervised learning approaches.

        "abstract": "Perception systems of autonomous vehicles are susceptible to occlusion, especially when examined from a vehicle-centric perspective. Such occlusion can lead to overlooked object detections, e.g., larger vehicles such as trucks or buses may create blind spots where cyclists or pedestrians could be obscured, accentuating the safety concerns associated with such perception system limitations. To mitigate these challenges, the vehicle-to-everything (V2X) paradigm suggests employing an infrastructure-side perception system (IPS) to complement autonomous vehicles with a broader perceptual scope. Nevertheless, the scarcity of real-world 3D infrastructure-side datasets constrains the advancement of V2X technologies. To bridge these gaps, this paper introduces a new 3D infrastructure-side collaborative perception dataset, abbreviated as inscope. Notably, InScope is the first dataset dedicated to addressing occlusion challenges by strategically deploying multiple-position Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) systems on the infrastructure side. Specifically, InScope encapsulates a 20-day capture duration with 303 tracking trajectories and 187,787 3D bounding boxes annotated by experts. Through analysis of benchmarks, four different benchmarks are presented for open traffic scenarios, including collaborative 3D object detection, multisource data fusion, data domain transfer, and 3D multiobject tracking tasks. Additionally, a new metric is designed to quantify the impact of occlusion, facilitating the evaluation of detection degradation ratios among various algorithms. The Experimental findings showcase the enhanced performance of leveraging InScope to assist in detecting and tracking 3D multiobjects in real-world scenarios, particularly in tracking obscured, small, and distant objects.

The increasing power of these tools, coupled with their ease of access, fuels the creation of photorealistic fake content, termed deepfakes, that raises substantial concerns about their potential misuse. In response, there has been notable progress in developing detection mechanisms to identify content produced by these advanced systems. However, existing methods often struggle to adapt to the continuously evolving landscape of deepfake generation. This paper introduces Prompt2Guard, a novel solution for exemplar-free continual deepfake detection of images, that leverages Vision-Language Models (VLMs) and domain-specific multimodal prompts. Compared to previous VLM-based approaches that are either bounded by prompt selection accuracy or necessitate multiple forward passes, we leverage a prediction ensembling technique with read-only prompts. Read-only prompts do not interact with VLMs internal representation, mitigating the need for multiple forward passes. Thus, we enhance efficiency and accuracy in detecting generated content. Additionally, our method exploits a text-prompt conditioning tailored to deepfake detection, which we demonstrate is beneficial in our setting. We evaluate Prompt2Guard on CDDB-Hard, a continual deepfake detection benchmark composed of five deepfake detection datasets spanning multiple domains and generators, achieving a new state-of-the-art. Additionally, our results underscore the effectiveness of our approach in addressing the challenges posed by continual deepfake detection, paving the way for more robust and adaptable solutions in deepfake detection.",

This capability is crucial for embodied intelligence and human-robot collaboration. The complete interaction process involves both pre-contact interaction intention (i.e., hand motion trends and interaction hotspots) and post-contact interaction manipulation (i.e., manipulation trajectories and hand poses with contact). Existing research typically anticipates only interaction intention while neglecting manipulation, resulting in incomplete predictions and an increased likelihood of intention errors due to the lack of manipulation constraints. To address this, we propose a novel model, PEAR (Phrase-Based Hand-Object Interaction Anticipation), which jointly anticipates interaction intention and manipulation. To handle uncertainties in the interaction process, we employ a twofold approach. Firstly, we perform cross-alignment of verbs, nouns, and images to reduce the diversity of hand movement patterns and object functional attributes, thereby mitigating intention uncertainty. Secondly, we establish bidirectional constraints between intention and manipulation using dynamic integration and residual connections, ensuring consistency among elements and thus overcoming manipulation uncertainty. To rigorously evaluate the performance of the proposed model, we collect a new task-relevant dataset, EGO-HOIP, with comprehensive annotations.

By crafting a heterogeneous dataset, we aim to fill this gap and enable robust models that maintain high accuracy across diverse image sources. However, the frequency distribution of road surface types and qualities is highly imbalanced. We address the challenge of ensuring sufficient images per class while reducing manual annotation by proposing a sampling strategy that incorporates various external label prediction resources. More precisely, we estimate the impact of (1) enriching the image data with OpenStreetMap tags, (2) iterative training and application of a custom surface type classification model, (3) amplifying underrepresented classes through prompt-based classification with GPT-4o or similarity search using image embeddings.

It is an important step toward high-level visual reasoning and scene understanding. However, due to the natural bias from the real world, existing methods mostly struggle with rare human-object pairs and lead to sub-optimal results. Recently, with the development of the generative model, a straightforward approach is to construct a more balanced dataset based on a group of supplementary samples. Unfortunately, there is a significant domain gap between the generated data and the original data, and simply merging the generated images into the original dataset cannot significantly boost the performance. To alleviate the above problem, we present a novel model-agnostic framework called \\textbf{C}ontext-\\textbf{E}nhanced \\textbf{F}eature \\textbf{A}lignment (CEFA) module, which can effectively align the generated data with the original data at the feature level and bridge the domain gap. Specifically, CEFA consists of a feature alignment module and a context enhancement module. On one hand, considering the crucial role of human-object pairs information in HOI tasks, the feature alignment module aligns the human-object pairs by aggregating instance information. On the other hand, to mitigate the issue of losing important context information caused by the traditional discriminator-style alignment method, we employ a context-enhanced image reconstruction module to improve the model's learning ability of contextual cues. Extensive experiments have shown that our method can serve as a plug-and-play module to improve the detection performance of HOI models on rare categories\\footnote{this https URL}.",

However, existing forensics methods struggle to detect unseen forgery types that they have not been trained on, leaving the development of a model capable of generalized detection of tampered scene text as an unresolved issue. To tackle this, we propose a novel task: open-set tampered scene text detection, which evaluates forensics models on their ability to identify both seen and previously unseen forgery types. We have curated a comprehensive, high-quality dataset, featuring the texts tampered by eight text editing models, to thoroughly assess the open-set generalization capabilities. Further, we introduce a novel and effective pre-training paradigm that subtly alters the texture of selected texts within an image and trains the model to identify these regions. This approach not only mitigates the scarcity of high-quality training data but also enhances models' fine-grained perception and open-set generalization abilities. Additionally, we present DAF, a novel framework that improves open-set generalization by distinguishing between the features of authentic and tampered text, rather than focusing solely on the tampered text's features. Our extensive experiments validate the remarkable efficacy of our methods. For example, our zero-shot performance can even beat the previous state-of-the-art full-shot model by a large margin.

Thus, there is a great demand for accurate video quality assessment (VQA) models to measure the perceptual quality of AI-generated content (AIGC) videos as well as optimize video generation techniques. However, assessing the quality of AIGC videos is quite challenging due to the highly complex distortions they exhibit (e.g., unnatural action, irrational objects, etc.). Therefore, in this paper, we try to systemically investigate the AIGC-VQA problem from both subjective and objective quality assessment perspectives. For the subjective perspective, we construct a Large-scale Generated Vdeo Quality assessment (LGVQ) dataset, consisting of 2,808 AIGC videos generated by 6 video generation models using 468 carefully selected text prompts. Unlike previous subjective VQA experiments, we evaluate the perceptual quality of AIGC videos from three dimensions: spatial quality, temporal quality, and text-to-video alignment, which hold utmost importance for current video generation techniques. For the objective perspective, we establish a benchmark for evaluating existing quality assessment metrics on the LGVQ dataset, which reveals that current metrics perform poorly on the LGVQ dataset. Thus, we propose a Unify Generated Video Quality assessment (UGVQ) model to comprehensively and accurately evaluate the quality of AIGC videos across three aspects using a unified model, which uses visual, textual and motion features of video and corresponding prompt, and integrates key features to enhance feature expression. We hope that our benchmark can promote the development of quality evaluation metrics for AIGC videos. The LGVQ dataset and the UGVQ metric will be publicly released.",

Potato yield can be estimated on a harvester using an RGB-D camera that can estimate the three-dimensional (3D) volume of individual potato tubers. A challenge, however, is that the 3D shape derived from RGB-D images is only partially completed, underestimating the actual volume. To address this issue, we developed a 3D shape completion network, called CoRe++, which can complete the 3D shape from RGB-D images. CoRe++ is a deep learning network that consists of a convolutional encoder and a decoder. The encoder compresses RGB-D images into latent vectors that are used by the decoder to complete the 3D shape using the deep signed distance field network (DeepSDF). To evaluate our CoRe++ network, we collected partial and complete 3D point clouds of 339 potato tubers on an operational harvester in Japan. On the 1425 RGB-D images in the test set (representing 51 unique potato tubers), our network achieved a completion accuracy of 2.8 mm on average. For volumetric estimation, the root mean squared error (RMSE) was 22.6 ml, and this was better than the RMSE of the linear regression (31.1 ml) and the base model (36.9 ml). We found that the RMSE can be further reduced to 18.2 ml when performing the 3D shape completion in the center of the RGB-D image. With an average 3D shape completion time of 10 milliseconds per tuber, we can conclude that CoRe++ is both fast and accurate enough to be implemented on an operational harvester for high-throughput potato yield estimation.

In this paper, we propose Direct Unlearning Optimization (DUO), a novel framework for removing Not Safe For Work (NSFW) content from T2I models while preserving their performance on unrelated topics. DUO employs a preference optimization approach using curated paired image data, ensuring that the model learns to remove unsafe visual concepts while retaining unrelated features. Furthermore, we introduce an output-preserving regularization term to maintain the model's generative capabilities on safe content. Extensive experiments demonstrate that DUO can robustly defend against various state-of-the-art red teaming methods without significant performance degradation on unrelated topics, as measured by FID and CLIP scores. Our work contributes to the development of safer and more reliable T2I models, paving the way for their responsible deployment in both closed-source and open-source scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Accurate identification of arteries and veins in ultrasound images is crucial for vascular examinations and interventions in robotics-assisted surgeries. However, current methods for ultrasound vessel segmentation face challenges in distinguishing between arteries and veins due to their morphological similarities. To address this challenge, this study introduces a novel force sensing guided segmentation approach to enhance artery-vein segmentation accuracy by leveraging their distinct deformability. Our proposed method utilizes force magnitude to identify key frames with the most significant vascular deformation in a sequence of ultrasound images. These key frames are then integrated with the current frame through attention mechanisms, with weights assigned in accordance with force magnitude. Our proposed force sensing guided framework can be seamlessly integrated into various segmentation networks and achieves significant performance improvements in multiple U-shaped networks such as U-Net, Swin-unet and Transunet. Furthermore, we contribute the first multimodal ultrasound artery-vein segmentation dataset, Mus-V, which encompasses both force and image data simultaneously. The dataset comprises 3114 ultrasound images of carotid and femoral vessels extracted from 105 videos, with corresponding force data recorded by the force sensor mounted on the US probe. Our code and dataset will be publicly available.",

Additionally, thorax CT scans from 72 subjects (33 healthy: 20 men, mean age [range] = 62.4 [34, 80]; 39 suffering from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: 25 men, mean age [range] = 69.0 [47, 91]) were retrospectively selected (10.2018-12.2019) from our in-house dataset such that for each subject, a frontal chest X-ray radiograph no older than seven days was available. All CT scans and their corresponding lung segmentation were forward projected using a simulated X-ray spectrum to generate synthetic radiographs and lung thickness maps, respectively. A U-Net model was trained and tested on synthetic radiographs from the public datasets to predict lung thickness maps and consequently estimate TLV. Model performance was further assessed by evaluating the TLV estimations for the in-house synthetic and real radiograph pairs using Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and significance testing.\n  Results: Strong correlations were measured between the predicted and CT-derived ground truth TLV values for test data from synthetic ($n_{Public}$=1,191, r=0.987, P < 0.001; $n_{In-house}$=72, r=0.973, P < 0.001) and real radiographs (n=72, r=0.908, P < 0.001).\n  Conclusion: TLV from U-Net-generated pixel-level lung thickness maps were successfully estimated for synthetic and real radiographs.",

The use of textual features helps mitigate cold-start problems, and thus, such recommender systems have attracted increased attention. However, we argue that the dependency on item descriptions makes the recommender system vulnerable to manipulation by adversarial sellers on e-commerce platforms. In this paper, we explore the possibility of such manipulation by proposing a new text rewriting framework to attack text-aware recommender systems. We show that the rewriting attack can be exploited by sellers to unfairly uprank their products, even though the adversarially rewritten descriptions are perceived as realistic by human evaluators. Methodologically, we investigate two different variations to carry out text rewriting attacks: (1) two-phase fine-tuning for greater attack performance, and (2) in-context learning for higher text rewriting quality. Experiments spanning 3 different datasets and 4 existing approaches demonstrate that recommender systems exhibit vulnerability against the proposed text rewriting attack. Our work adds to the existing literature around the robustness of recommender systems, while highlighting a new dimension of vulnerability in the age of large-scale automated text generation.",

Recently, some studies have started to explore the use of multi-scenario information for recommendations, such as model-based and data-based approaches. However, the matching stage faces significant challenges due to the need for ultra-large-scale retrieval and meeting low latency requirements. As a result, the methods applied at this stage (collaborative filtering and two-tower models) are often designed to be lightweight, hindering the full utilization of extensive information. On the other hand, the ranking stage features the most sophisticated models with the strongest scoring capabilities, but due to the limited screen size of mobile devices, most of the ranked results may not gain exposure or be displayed. In this paper, we introduce an innovative multi-scenario nearline retrieval framework. It operates by harnessing ranking logs from various scenarios through Flink, allowing us to incorporate finely ranked results from other scenarios into our matching stage in near real-time. Besides, we propose a streaming scoring module, which selects a crucial subset from the candidate pool. Implemented on the \"Guess You Like\" (homepage of the Taobao APP), China's premier e-commerce platform, our method has shown substantial improvements-most notably, a 5% uptick in product transactions. Furthermore, the proposed approach is not only model-free but also highly efficient, suggesting it can be quickly implemented in diverse scenarios and demonstrate promising performance.",

Existing CDR methods prefer to either learn a common preference bridge shared by all users or a personalized preference bridge tailored for each user to transfer user preference from the source domain to the target domain. Although these methods significantly improve the recommendation performance, there are still some limitations. First, these methods usually assume a user only has a unique interest, while ignoring the fact that a user may interact with items with different interest preferences. Second, they learn transformed preference representation mainly relies on the source domain signals, while neglecting the rich information available in the target domain. To handle these issues, in this paper, we propose a novel method named Multi-interest Meta Network with Multi-granularity Target-guided Attention (MIMNet) for cross-domain recommendation. To be specific, we employ the capsule network to learn user multiple interests in the source domain, which will be fed into a meta network to generate multiple interest-level preference bridges. Then, we transfer user representations from the source domain to the target domain based on these multi-interest bridges. In addition, we introduce both fine-grained and coarse-grained target signals to aggregate user transformed interest-level representations by incorporating a novel multi-granularity target-guided attention network.

However, this assumption often fails in the presence of out-of-distribution (OOD) data, resulting in significant performance degradation. In this study, we construct a Structural Causal Model (SCM) to analyze interaction data, revealing that environmental confounders (e.g., the COVID-19 pandemic) lead to unstable correlations in GNN-based models, thus impairing their generalization to OOD data. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach, graph representation learning via causal diffusion (CausalDiffRec) for OOD recommendation. This method enhances the model's generalization on OOD data by eliminating environmental confounding factors and learning invariant graph representations. Specifically, we use backdoor adjustment and variational inference to infer the real environmental distribution, thereby eliminating the impact of environmental confounders. This inferred distribution is then used as prior knowledge to guide the representation learning in the reverse phase of the diffusion process to learn the invariant representation. In addition, we provide a theoretical derivation that proves optimizing the objective function of CausalDiffRec can encourage the model to learn environment-invariant graph representations, thereby achieving excellent generalization performance in recommendations under distribution shifts. Our extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of CausalDiffRec in improving the generalization of OOD data, and the average improvement is up to 10.69% on Food, 18.83% on KuaiRec, 22.41% on Yelp2018, and 11.65% on Douban datasets.",

To fill in the missing points, recent studies tend to explore new visual features and design complex networks to reconstruct the depth, however, these approaches tremendously increase computation, and the correlation of different visual features remains a problem. To this end, we propose an efficient depth completion network named DistillGrasp which distillates knowledge from the teacher branch to the student branch. Specifically, in the teacher branch, we design a position correlation block (PCB) that leverages RGB images as the query and key to search for the corresponding values, guiding the model to establish correct correspondence between two features and transfer it to the transparent areas. For the student branch, we propose a consistent feature correlation module (CFCM) that retains the reliable regions of RGB images and depth maps respectively according to the consistency and adopts a CNN to capture the pairwise relationship for depth completion. To avoid the student branch only learning regional features from the teacher branch, we devise a distillation loss that not only considers the distance loss but also the object structure and edge information. Extensive experiments conducted on the ClearGrasp dataset manifest that our teacher network outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy and generalization, and the student network achieves competitive results with a higher speed of 48 FPS.

Such a binary label assignment is generally limited to assuring a higher recommendation score of the positive item, neglecting potential structures induced by varying preferences between other unobserved items. To alleviate this issue, we propose a novel method that extends original objectives to explicitly leverage the different levels of preferences as relative orders between their scores.

Previous work on cross-modal coherence modeling attempted to leverage the order information from another modality to assist the coherence recovering of the target modality. Despite of the effectiveness, labeled associated coherency information is not always available and might be costly to acquire, making the cross-modal guidance hard to leverage. To tackle this challenge, this paper explores a new way to take advantage of cross-modal guidance without gold labels on coherency, and proposes the Weak Cross-Modal Guided Ordering (WeGO) model. More specifically, it leverages high-confidence predicted pairwise order in one modality as reference information to guide the coherence modeling in another. An iterative learning paradigm is further designed to jointly optimize the coherence modeling in two modalities with selected guidance from each other. The iterative cross-modal boosting also functions in inference to further enhance coherence prediction in each modality. Experimental results on two public datasets have demonstrated that the proposed method outperforms existing methods for cross-modal coherence modeling tasks.

In this paper, we propose a novel privacy protection method in the multiscale sparsified feature subspaces to protect sensitive facial features, by taking care of the influence or weight ranked feature coefficients on the privacy budget, named \"Ranked Differential Privacy (RDP)\". After the multiscale feature decomposition, the lightweight Laplacian noise is added to the dimension-reduced sparsified feature coefficients according to the geometric superposition method. Then, we rigorously prove that the RDP satisfies Differential Privacy. After that, the nonlinear Lagrange Multiplier (LM) method is formulated for the constraint optimization problem of maximizing the utility of the visualization quality protected face images with sanitizing noise, under a given facial features privacy budget. Then, two methods are proposed to solve the nonlinear LM problem and obtain the optimal noise scale parameters: 1) the analytical Normalization Approximation (NA) method with identical average noise scale parameter for real-time online applications; and 2) the LM optimization Gradient Descent (LMGD) numerical method to obtain the nonlinear solution through iterative updating for more accurate offline applications. Experimental results on two real-world datasets show that our proposed RDP outperforms other state-of-the-art methods: at a privacy budget of 0.2, the PSNR (Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio) of the RDP is about ~10 dB higher than (10 times as high as) the highest PSNR of all compared methods.",

Fortunately, we find that there is a great opportunity to exploit the heterogeneity in inference compute properties and fluctuations in inference workloads, to significantly improve energy-efficiency. However, such a diverse and dynamic environment creates a large search-space where different system configurations (e.g., number of instances, model parallelism, and GPU frequency) translate into different energy-performance trade-offs.

In this paper, we introduce a novel inference methodology termed next-sentence prediction, aimed at enhancing the inference efficiency of LLMs. We present SentenceVAE, a tiny model consisting of an encoder and a decoder. The encoder effectively condenses the information within a sentence into a singular token, while the decoder reconstructs this compressed data back into its original sentential form. By integrating SentenceVAE into the input and output layers of LLMs, we develop Sentence-level LLMs (SLLMs) that employ a sentence-by-sentence inference approach, markedly accelerating inference speeds. SentenceVAE also maintains the integrity of the original semantic content by segmenting the text into sentences, thereby preserving accuracy while boosting inference speeds. Compared to traditional LLMs, SLLMs process fewer tokens over equivalent context lengths, significantly reducing memory demands for Self-Attention computations and facilitating the handling of longer contexts. Our experimental findings reveal that this method can increase inference speeds by 204~365%, reduce perplexity (PPL) to 46~75% of its original metric, and decrease memory overhead by 86~91% for the same context length. The advantages of this approach are further amplified with increases in model parameters.",

Within this spectrum, text-to-image (TTI) models have emerged as a formidable approach to generating varied and aesthetically appealing compositions, spanning applications from artistic creation to realistic facial synthesis, and demonstrating significant advancements in computer vision, image processing, and multimodal tasks. The advent of Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) signifies a paradigm shift in the domain of AI capabilities. This article delves into the feasibility of employing the Stable Diffusion LDM to illustrate literary works. For this exploration, seven classic Brazilian books have been selected as case studies. The objective is to ascertain the practicality of this endeavor and to evaluate the potential of Stable Diffusion in producing illustrations that augment and enrich the reader's experience. We will outline the beneficial aspects, such as the capacity to generate distinctive and contextually pertinent images, as well as the drawbacks, including any shortcomings in faithfully capturing the essence of intricate literary depictions. Through this study, we aim to provide a comprehensive assessment of the viability and efficacy of utilizing AI-generated illustrations in literary contexts, elucidating both the prospects and challenges encountered in this pioneering application of technology.",

It is therefore natural to wonder if those embeddings contain enough information to be able to connect those meanings through ontological relationships such as the one of subsumption. If so, large knowledge models could be built that are capable of semantically relating terms based on the information encapsulated in word embeddings produced by pre-trained models, with implications not only for ontologies (ontology matching, ontology evolution, etc.) but also on the ability to integrate ontological knowledge in neural models. In this paper, we test how embeddings produced by several pre-trained models can be used to predict relations existing between classes and properties of popular upper-level and general ontologies. We show that even a simple feed-forward architecture on top of those embeddings can achieve promising accuracies, with varying generalisation abilities depending on the input data. To achieve that, we produce a dataset that can be used to further enhance those models, opening new possibilities for applications integrating knowledge from web ontologies.",

With the rapid advancement in connected technologies, such as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, valuable information from alternate views becomes accessible via wireless networks. The integration of information from alternative views has the potential to overcome the inherent limitations associated with a single viewpoint, such as occlusions and limited field of view. In this work, we introduce V2INet, a novel trajectory prediction framework designed to model multi-view data by extending existing single-view models. Unlike previous approaches where the multi-view data is manually fused or formulated as a separate training stage, our model supports end-to-end training, enhancing both flexibility and performance. Moreover, the predicted multimodal trajectories are calibrated by a post-hoc conformal prediction module to get valid and efficient confidence regions.

Taking the generation of a combination of two disentangled concepts as an example, say given the prompt \"a tea cup of iced coke\", existing models usually generate a glass cup of iced coke because the iced coke usually co-occurs with the glass cup instead of the tea one during model training. The root of such misalignment is attributed to the confusion in the latent semantic space of text-to-image diffusion models, and hence we refer to the \"a tea cup of iced coke\" phenomenon as Latent Concept Misalignment (LC-Mis). We leverage large language models (LLMs) to thoroughly investigate the scope of LC-Mis, and develop an automated pipeline for aligning the latent semantics of diffusion models to text prompts. Empirical assessments confirm the effectiveness of our approach, substantially reducing LC-Mis errors and enhancing the robustness and versatility of text-to-image diffusion models.

They can possess considerable medical knowledge, but may still hallucinate and are inflexible in the knowledge updates. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has been proposed to enhance the medical question-answering capabilities of LLMs with external knowledge bases, it may still fail in complex cases where multiple rounds of information-seeking are required. To address such an issue, we propose iterative RAG for medicine (i-MedRAG), where LLMs can iteratively ask follow-up queries based on previous information-seeking attempts. In each iteration of i-MedRAG, the follow-up queries will be answered by a vanilla RAG system and they will be further used to guide the query generation in the next iteration. Our experiments show the improved performance of various LLMs brought by i-MedRAG compared with vanilla RAG on complex questions from clinical vignettes in the United States Medical Licensing Examination (USMLE), as well as various knowledge tests in the Massive Multitask Language Understanding (MMLU) dataset. Notably, our zero-shot i-MedRAG outperforms all existing prompt engineering and fine-tuning methods on GPT-3.5, achieving an accuracy of 69.68\\% on the MedQA dataset. In addition, we characterize the scaling properties of i-MedRAG with different iterations of follow-up queries and different numbers of queries per iteration. Our case studies show that i-MedRAG can flexibly ask follow-up queries to form reasoning chains, providing an in-depth analysis of medical questions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first-of-its-kind study on incorporating follow-up queries into medical RAG.",

For specific problems, discretizing the material field with a neural network (NN) improves the robustness and reconstruction quality of the corresponding optimization problem. We call this method NN-based FWI. Starting from an initial guess, the weights of the NN are iteratively updated to fit the simulated wave signals to the sparsely measured data set. For gradient-based optimization, a suitable choice of the initial guess, i.e., a suitable NN weight initialization, is crucial for fast and robust convergence.\n  In this paper, we introduce a novel transfer learning approach to further improve NN-based FWI. This approach leverages supervised pretraining to provide a better NN weight initialization, leading to faster convergence of the subsequent optimization problem. Moreover, the inversions yield physically more meaningful local minima. The network is pretrained to predict the unknown material field using the gradient information from the first iteration of conventional FWI. In our computational experiments on two-dimensional domains, the training data set consists of reference simulations with arbitrarily positioned elliptical voids of different shapes and orientations.

In this study, we investigated to what extent fine-tuning open-source LLMs can further improve their performance in summarizing medical evidence. Utilizing a benchmark dataset, MedReview, consisting of 8,161 pairs of systematic reviews and summaries, we fine-tuned three broadly-used, open-sourced LLMs, namely PRIMERA, LongT5, and Llama-2.

This hallucination phenomenon is even more severe when querying the image in non-English languages, while existing methods for mitigating hallucinations in LVLMs only consider the English scenarios. In this paper, we make the first attempt to mitigate this important multilingual hallucination in LVLMs. With thorough experiment analysis, we found that multilingual hallucination in LVLMs is a systemic problem that could arise from deficiencies in multilingual capabilities or inadequate multimodal abilities. To this end, we propose a two-stage Multilingual Hallucination Removal (MHR) framework for LVLMs, aiming to improve resistance to hallucination for both high-resource and low-resource languages. Instead of relying on the intricate manual annotations of multilingual resources, we fully leverage the inherent capabilities of the LVLM and propose a novel cross-lingual alignment method, which generates multiple responses for each image-query input and then identifies the hallucination-aware pairs for each language. These data pairs are finally used for direct preference optimization to prompt the LVLMs to favor non-hallucinating responses. Experimental results show that our MHR achieves a substantial reduction in hallucination generation for LVLMs. Notably, on our extended multilingual POPE benchmark, our framework delivers an average increase of 19.0% in accuracy across 13 different languages.

We first proposed a blind iris image restoration network called Iris-PPRGAN. To effectively restore the texture of the blind iris, Iris-PPRGAN includes a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) used as a Prior Decoder, and a DNN used as the encoder. To extract iris features more efficiently, we then proposed a robust iris classifier by modifying the bottleneck module of InsightFace, which called Insight-Iris. A low-quality blind iris image is first restored by Iris-PPRGAN, then the restored iris image undergoes recognition via Insight-Iris. Experimental results on the public CASIA-Iris-distance dataset demonstrate that our proposed method significantly superior results to state-of-the-art blind iris restoration methods both quantitatively and qualitatively, Specifically, the recognition rate for long-distance blind iris images reaches 90% after processing with our methods, representing an improvement of approximately ten percentage points compared to images without restoration.",

        "abstract": "The recent success of large vision language models shows great potential in driving the agent system operating on user interfaces. However, we argue that the power multimodal models like GPT-4V as a general agent on multiple operating systems across different applications is largely underestimated due to the lack of a robust screen parsing technique capable of: 1) reliably identifying interactable icons within the user interface, and 2) understanding the semantics of various elements in a screenshot and accurately associate the intended action with the corresponding region on the screen. To fill these gaps, we introduce \\textsc{OmniParser}, a comprehensive method for parsing user interface screenshots into structured elements, which significantly enhances the ability of GPT-4V to generate actions that can be accurately grounded in the corresponding regions of the interface. We first curated an interactable icon detection dataset using popular webpages and an icon description dataset. These datasets were utilized to fine-tune specialized models: a detection model to parse interactable regions on the screen and a caption model to extract the functional semantics of the detected elements. \\textsc{OmniParser} significantly improves GPT-4V's performance on ScreenSpot benchmark. And on Mind2Web and AITW benchmark, \\textsc{OmniParser} with screenshot only input outperforms the GPT-4V baselines requiring additional information outside of screenshot.",

We evaluate the effectiveness of open source GPT models for the task of automatic identification of the presence of vulnerable code syntax (specifically targeting C and C++ source code). This task is evaluated on a selection of 36 source code examples from the NIST SARD dataset, which are specifically curated to not contain natural English that indicates the presence, or lack thereof, of a particular vulnerability. The NIST SARD source code dataset contains identified vulnerable lines of source code that are examples of one out of the 839 distinct Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE), allowing for exact quantification of the GPT output classification error rate. A total of 5 GPT models are evaluated, using 10 different inference temperatures and 100 repetitions at each setting, resulting in 5,000 GPT queries per vulnerable source code analyzed. Ultimately, we find that the GPT models that we evaluated are not suitable for fully automated vulnerability scanning because the false positive and false negative rates are too high to likely be useful in practice. However, we do find that the GPT models perform surprisingly well at automated vulnerability detection for some of the test cases, in particular surpassing random sampling, and being able to identify the exact lines of code that are vulnerable albeit at a low success rate. The best performing GPT model result found was Llama-2-70b-chat-hf with inference temperature of 0.1 applied to NIST SARD test case 149165 (which is an example of a buffer overflow vulnerability), which had a binary classification recall score of 1.0 and a precision of 1.0 for correctly and uniquely identifying the vulnerable line of code and the correct CWE number.",

        "abstract": "Advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shown their effectiveness in multiple complicated natural language reasoning tasks. A key challenge remains in adapting these models efficiently to new or unfamiliar tasks. In-context learning (ICL) provides a promising solution for few-shot adaptation by retrieving a set of data points relevant to a query, called in-context examples (ICE), from a training dataset and providing them during the inference as context. Most existing studies utilize a centralized training dataset, yet many real-world datasets may be distributed among multiple clients, and remote data retrieval can be associated with costs. Especially when the client data are non-identical independent distributions (non-IID), retrieving from clients a proper set of ICEs needed for a test query presents critical challenges. In this paper, we first show that in this challenging setting, test queries will have different preferences among clients because of non-IIDness, and equal contribution often leads to suboptimal performance. We then introduce a novel approach to tackle the distributed non-IID ICL problem when a data usage budget is present. The principle is that each client's proper contribution (budget) should be designed according to the preference of each query for that client. Our approach uses a data-driven manner to allocate a budget for each client, tailored to each test query. Through extensive empirical studies on diverse datasets, our framework demonstrates superior performance relative to competing baselines.",

Therefore, this paper focuses on the more challenging task of artistic text segmentation and constructs a real artistic text segmentation dataset. One challenge of the task is that the local stroke shapes of artistic text are changeable with diversity and complexity. We propose a decoder with the layer-wise momentum query to prevent the model from ignoring stroke regions of special shapes. Another challenge is the complexity of the global topological structure. We further design a skeleton-assisted head to guide the model to focus on the global structure. Additionally, to enhance the generalization performance of the text segmentation model, we propose a strategy for training data synthesis, based on the large multi-modal model and the diffusion model.

        "abstract": "Audio-driven 3D facial animation aims to map input audio to realistic facial motion. Despite significant progress, limitations arise from inconsistent 3D annotations, restricting previous models to training on specific annotations and thereby constraining the training scale. In this work, we present UniTalker, a unified model featuring a multi-head architecture designed to effectively leverage datasets with varied annotations. To enhance training stability and ensure consistency among multi-head outputs, we employ three training strategies, namely, PCA, model warm-up, and pivot identity embedding. To expand the training scale and diversity, we assemble A2F-Bench, comprising five publicly available datasets and three newly curated datasets. These datasets contain a wide range of audio domains, covering multilingual speech voices and songs, thereby scaling the training data from commonly employed datasets, typically less than 1 hour, to 18.5 hours. With a single trained UniTalker model, we achieve substantial lip vertex error reductions of 9.2% for BIWI dataset and 13.7% for Vocaset. Additionally, the pre-trained UniTalker exhibits promise as the foundation model for audio-driven facial animation tasks. Fine-tuning the pre-trained UniTalker on seen datasets further enhances performance on each dataset, with an average error reduction of 6.3% on A2F-Bench. Moreover, fine-tuning UniTalker on an unseen dataset with only half the data surpasses prior state-of-the-art models trained on the full dataset.

Despite their potential, current top models within our community still fall short in adequately understanding spatial and temporal dimensions. We introduce Coarse Correspondence, a simple, training-free, effective, and general-purpose visual prompting method to elicit 3D and temporal understanding in multimodal LLMs. Our method uses a lightweight tracking model to find object correspondences between frames in a video or between sets of image viewpoints. It selects the most frequent object instances and visualizes them with markers with unique IDs in the image. With this simple approach, we achieve state-of-the-art results on 3D understanding benchmarks including ScanQA (+20.5\\%) and a subset of OpenEQA (+9.7\\%), and on long-form video benchmarks such as EgoSchema (+6.0\\%). We also curate a small diagnostic dataset to evaluate whether MLLMs can reason about space from a described viewpoint other than the camera viewpoint. Again, Coarse Correspondence improves spatial perspective-taking abilities but we highlight that MLLMs struggle with this task. Together, we demonstrate that our simple prompting method can significantly aid downstream tasks that require 3D or temporal reasoning.",

We build a methodology to semi-automatically collect a dataset of triplets in the form of (i) a source motion, (ii) a target motion, and (iii) an edit text, and create the new MotionFix dataset. Having access to such data allows us to train a conditional diffusion model, TMED, that takes both the source motion and the edit text as input. We further build various baselines trained only on text-motion pairs datasets, and show superior performance of our model trained on triplets. We introduce new retrieval-based metrics for motion editing and establish a new benchmark on the evaluation set of MotionFix.

While pre-training is usually performed on large real-world image datasets, in this paper we ask whether this is truly necessary. To this end, we search for a minimal, purely synthetic pre-training dataset that allows us to achieve performance similar to the 1 million images of ImageNet-1k. We construct such a dataset from a single fractal with perturbations. With this, we contribute three main findings. (i) We show that pre-training is effective even with minimal synthetic images, with performance on par with large-scale pre-training datasets like ImageNet-1k for full fine-tuning. (ii) We investigate the single parameter with which we construct artificial categories for our dataset. We find that while the shape differences can be indistinguishable to humans, they are crucial for obtaining strong performances. (iii) Finally, we investigate the minimal requirements for successful pre-training. Surprisingly, we find that a substantial reduction of synthetic images from 1k to 1 can even lead to an increase in pre-training performance, a motivation to further investigate ``scaling backwards''. Finally, we extend our method from synthetic images to real images to see if a single real image can show similar pre-training effect through shape augmentation. We find that the use of grayscale images and affine transformations allows even real images to ``scale backwards''.",

Explainable AI (XAI) addresses this challenge by providing additional information to help users understand the internal decision-making process of ML models. In the field of neuroscience, enriching a ML model for brain decoding with attribution-based XAI techniques means being able to highlight which brain areas correlate with the task at hand, thus offering valuable insights to domain experts. In this paper, we analyze human and Computer Vision (CV) systems in parallel, training and explaining two ML models based respectively on functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) and movie frames. We do so by leveraging the \"StudyForrest\" dataset, which includes functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) scans of subjects watching the \"Forrest Gump\" movie, emotion annotations, and eye-tracking data. For human vision the ML task is to link fMRI data with emotional annotations, and the explanations highlight the brain regions strongly correlated with the label. On the other hand, for computer vision, the input data is movie frames, and the explanations are pixel-level heatmaps. We cross-analyzed our results, linking human attention (obtained through eye-tracking) with XAI saliency on CV models and brain region activations.

        "abstract": "Recent years have seen a tremendous improvement in the quality of video generation and editing approaches. While several techniques focus on editing appearance, few address motion. Current approaches using text, trajectories, or bounding boxes are limited to simple motions, so we specify motions with a single motion reference video instead. We further propose to use a pre-trained image-to-video model rather than a text-to-video model. This approach allows us to preserve the exact appearance and position of a target object or scene and helps disentangle appearance from motion. Our method, called motion-textual inversion, leverages our observation that image-to-video models extract appearance mainly from the (latent) image input, while the text/image embedding injected via cross-attention predominantly controls motion. We thus represent motion using text/image embedding tokens. By operating on an inflated motion-text embedding containing multiple text/image embedding tokens per frame, we achieve a high temporal motion granularity. Once optimized on the motion reference video, this embedding can be applied to various target images to generate videos with semantically similar motions. Our approach does not require spatial alignment between the motion reference video and target image, generalizes across various domains, and can be applied to various tasks such as full-body and face reenactment, as well as controlling the motion of inanimate objects and the camera. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in the semantic video motion transfer task, significantly outperforming existing methods in this context.",

Most defect generation methods are only trained on a single product without considering the consistencies among multiple products, leading to poor quality and diversity of generated results. To address these issues, we propose DefectDiffu, a novel text-guided diffusion method to model both intra-product background consistency and inter-product defect consistency across multiple products and modulate the consistency perturbation directions to control product type and defect strength, achieving diversified defect image generation. Firstly, we leverage a text encoder to separately provide consistency prompts for background, defect, and fusion parts of the disentangled integrated architecture, thereby disentangling defects and normal backgrounds. Secondly, we propose the double-free strategy to generate defect images through two-stage perturbation of consistency direction, thereby controlling product type and defect strength by adjusting the perturbation scale. Besides, DefectDiffu can generate defect mask annotations utilizing cross-attention maps from the defect part. Finally, to improve the generation quality of small defects and masks, we propose the adaptive attention-enhance loss to increase the attention to defects. Experimental results demonstrate that DefectDiffu surpasses state-of-the-art methods in terms of generation quality and diversity, thus effectively improving downstream defection performance.

Despite growing interest in T2M, few methods focus on safeguarding these models against adversarial attacks, with existing work on text-to-image models proving insufficient for the unique motion domain. In the paper, we propose ALERT-Motion, an autonomous framework leveraging large language models (LLMs) to craft targeted adversarial attacks against black-box T2M models. Unlike prior methods modifying prompts through predefined rules, ALERT-Motion uses LLMs' knowledge of human motion to autonomously generate subtle yet powerful adversarial text descriptions. It comprises two key modules: an adaptive dispatching module that constructs an LLM-based agent to iteratively refine and search for adversarial prompts; and a multimodal information contrastive module that extracts semantically relevant motion information to guide the agent's search. Through this LLM-driven approach, ALERT-Motion crafts adversarial prompts querying victim models to produce outputs closely matching targeted motions, while avoiding obvious perturbations. Evaluations across popular T2M models demonstrate ALERT-Motion's superiority over previous methods, achieving higher attack success rates with stealthier adversarial prompts.

        "abstract": "Neural implicit representation, the parameterization of distance function as a coordinate neural field, has emerged as a promising lead in tackling surface reconstruction from unoriented point clouds. To enforce consistent orientation, existing methods focus on regularizing the gradient of the distance function, such as constraining it to be of the unit norm, minimizing its divergence, or aligning it with the eigenvector of Hessian that corresponds to zero eigenvalue. However, under the presence of large scanning noise, they tend to either overfit the noise input or produce an excessively smooth reconstruction. In this work, we propose to guide the surface reconstruction under a new variant of neural field, the octahedral field, leveraging the spherical harmonics representation of octahedral frames originated in the hexahedral meshing. Such field automatically snaps to geometry features when constrained to be smooth, and naturally preserves sharp angles when interpolated over creases. By simultaneously fitting and smoothing the octahedral field alongside the implicit geometry, it behaves analogously to bilateral filtering, resulting in smooth reconstruction while preserving sharp edges.

This entails identifying (i) what is being said, i.e., detecting the texts on each page and classifying them into essential vs non-essential, and (ii) who is saying it, i.e., attributing each dialogue to its speaker, while ensuring the same characters are named consistently throughout the chapter.\n  To this end, we introduce: (i) Magiv2, a model that is capable of generating high-quality chapter-wide manga transcripts with named characters and significantly higher precision in speaker diarisation over prior works; (ii) an extension of the PopManga evaluation dataset, which now includes annotations for speech-bubble tail boxes, associations of text to corresponding tails, classifications of text as essential or non-essential, and the identity for each character box; and (iii) a new character bank dataset, which comprises over 11K characters from 76 manga series, featuring 11.5K exemplar character images in total, as well as a list of chapters in which they appear.

        "abstract": "We present a novel approach for synthesizing 3D talking heads with controllable emotion, featuring enhanced lip synchronization and rendering quality. Despite significant progress in the field, prior methods still suffer from multi-view consistency and a lack of emotional expressiveness. To address these issues, we collect EmoTalk3D dataset with calibrated multi-view videos, emotional annotations, and per-frame 3D geometry. By training on the EmoTalk3D dataset, we propose a \\textit{`Speech-to-Geometry-to-Appearance'} mapping framework that first predicts faithful 3D geometry sequence from the audio features, then the appearance of a 3D talking head represented by 4D Gaussians is synthesized from the predicted geometry. The appearance is further disentangled into canonical and dynamic Gaussians, learned from multi-view videos, and fused to render free-view talking head animation. Moreover, our model enables controllable emotion in the generated talking heads and can be rendered in wide-range views. Our method exhibits improved rendering quality and stability in lip motion generation while capturing dynamic facial details such as wrinkles and subtle expressions. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating high-fidelity and emotion-controllable 3D talking heads. The code and EmoTalk3D dataset are released at this https URL.",

While recent advancements have demonstrated the efficacy of leveraging synthetic data for building such parametric head models, their performance remains inadequate in crucial areas such as expression-driven animation, hairstyle editing, and text-based modifications. In this paper, we build a dataset of artist-designed high-fidelity human heads and propose to create a novel parametric 360\u00b0 renderable parametric head model from it. Our scheme decouples the facial motion/shape and facial appearance, which are represented by a classic parametric 3D mesh model and an attached neural texture, respectively. We further propose a training method for decompositing hairstyle and facial appearance, allowing free-swapping of the hairstyle. A novel inversion fitting method is presented based on single image input with high generalization and fidelity. To the best of our knowledge, our model is the first parametric 3D full-head that achieves 360\u00b0 free-view synthesis, image-based fitting, appearance editing, and animation within a single model. Experiments show that facial motions and appearances are well disentangled in the parametric space, leading to SOTA performance in rendering and animating quality.

Contemporary techniques often require extensive annotated training data, yet obtaining point-wise annotations for point clouds is time-consuming and laborious. Recent developments in semi-supervised methods seek to mitigate this problem by employing a teacher-student framework to generate pseudo-labels for unlabeled point clouds. However, these pseudo-labels frequently suffer from insufficient diversity and inferior quality. To overcome these hurdles, we introduce an Agent-based Diffusion Model for Semi-supervised 3D Object Detection (Diff3DETR). Specifically, an agent-based object query generator is designed to produce object queries that effectively adapt to dynamic scenes while striking a balance between sampling locations and content embedding. Additionally, a box-aware denoising module utilizes the DDIM denoising process and the long-range attention in the transformer decoder to refine bounding boxes incrementally.

The key insight of our methods is to establish implicit-semantic area matching prior to point matching, based on advanced image understanding of SAM. Then, informative area matches with consistent internal semantic are able to undergo dense feature comparison, facilitating precise inside-area point matching. Specifically, MESA adopts a sparse matching framework and first obtains candidate areas from SAM results through a novel Area Graph (AG). Then, area matching among the candidates is formulated as graph energy minimization and solved by graphical models derived from AG. To address the efficiency issue of MESA, we further propose DMESA as its dense counterpart, applying a dense matching framework. After candidate areas are identified by AG, DMESA establishes area matches through generating dense matching distributions. The distributions are produced from off-the-shelf patch matching utilizing the Gaussian Mixture Model and refined via the Expectation Maximization. With less repetitive computation, DMESA showcases a speed improvement of nearly five times compared to MESA, while maintaining competitive accuracy. Our methods are extensively evaluated on five datasets encompassing indoor and outdoor scenes. The results illustrate consistent performance improvements from our methods for five distinct point matching baselines across all datasets.

This performance drop is mainly caused by the limited number of initial points generated from the sparse input, insufficient supervision during the training process, and inadequate regularization of the oversized Gaussian ellipsoids. To handle these issues, we propose the LoopSparseGS, a loop-based 3DGS framework for the sparse novel view synthesis task. In specific, we propose a loop-based Progressive Gaussian Initialization (PGI) strategy that could iteratively densify the initialized point cloud using the rendered pseudo images during the training process. Then, the sparse and reliable depth from the Structure from Motion, and the window-based dense monocular depth are leveraged to provide precise geometric supervision via the proposed Depth-alignment Regularization (DAR). Additionally, we introduce a novel Sparse-friendly Sampling (SFS) strategy to handle oversized Gaussian ellipsoids leading to large pixel errors. Comprehensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate that LoopSparseGS outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods for sparse-input novel view synthesis, across indoor, outdoor, and object-level scenes with various image resolutions.",

However, simply fully fine-tuning the pre-trained model could cause overfitting due to the scarcity of video samples. Additionally, we argue that the exploration of task-specific information is insufficient when relying solely on well extracted abstract features. In this work, we propose a simple but effective task-specific adaptation method (Task-Adapter) for few-shot action recognition. By introducing the proposed Task-Adapter into the last several layers of the backbone and keeping the parameters of the original pre-trained model frozen, we mitigate the overfitting problem caused by full fine-tuning and advance the task-specific mechanism into the process of feature extraction. In each Task-Adapter, we reuse the frozen self-attention layer to perform task-specific self-attention across different videos within the given task to capture both distinctive information among classes and shared information within classes, which facilitates task-specific adaptation and enhances subsequent metric measurement between the query feature and support prototypes. Experimental results consistently demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Task-Adapter on four standard few-shot action recognition datasets.

Specifically, the model struggles with medical images that feature low contrast, faint boundaries, intricate morphologies, and small-sized objects. To address these challenges and enhance SAM's performance in the medical domain, we introduce a comprehensive modification. Firstly, we incorporate a frozen Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) branch as an image encoder, which synergizes with SAM's original Vision Transformer (ViT) encoder through a novel variational attention fusion module. This integration bolsters the model's capability to capture local spatial information, which is often paramount in medical imagery. Moreover, to further optimize SAM for medical imaging, we introduce feature and position adapters within the ViT branch, refining the encoder's representations. We see that compared to current prompting strategies to fine-tune SAM for ultrasound medical segmentation, the use of text descriptions that serve as text prompts for SAM helps significantly improve the performance. Leveraging ChatGPT's natural language understanding capabilities, we generate prompts that offer contextual information and guidance to SAM, enabling it to better understand the nuances of ultrasound medical images and improve its segmentation accuracy.

In contrast, to both tasks, which handle video object segmentation in an off-line manner (i.e., pre-recorded sequences), we propose through ziVOS to target online recorded sequences. Here, we strive to strike a balance between performance and robustness for long-term scenarios by soliciting user feedback's on-the-fly during the segmentation process. Hence, we aim to maximize the tracking duration of an object of interest, while requiring minimal user corrections to maintain tracking over an extended period. We propose a competitive baseline, i.e., Lazy-XMem, as a reference for future works in ziVOS. Our proposed approach uses an uncertainty estimation of the tracking state to determine whether a user interaction is necessary to refine the model's prediction. To quantitatively assess the performance of our method and the user's workload, we introduce complementary metrics alongside those already established in the field.

        "abstract": "This work addresses the certification of the local robustness of vision-based two-stage 6D object pose estimation. The two-stage method for object pose estimation achieves superior accuracy by first employing deep neural network-driven keypoint regression and then applying a Perspective-n-Point (PnP) technique. Despite advancements, the certification of these methods' robustness remains scarce. This research aims to fill this gap with a focus on their local robustness on the system level--the capacity to maintain robust estimations amidst semantic input perturbations. The core idea is to transform the certification of local robustness into neural network verification for classification tasks. The challenge is to develop model, input, and output specifications that align with off-the-shelf verification tools. To facilitate verification, we modify the keypoint detection model by substituting nonlinear operations with those more amenable to the verification processes. Instead of injecting random noise into images, as is common, we employ a convex hull representation of images as input specifications to more accurately depict semantic perturbations. Furthermore, by conducting a sensitivity analysis, we propagate the robustness criteria from pose to keypoint accuracy, and then formulating an optimal error threshold allocation problem that allows for the setting of a maximally permissible keypoint deviation thresholds. Viewing each pixel as an individual class, these thresholds result in linear, classification-akin output specifications. Under certain conditions, we demonstrate that the main components of our certification framework are both sound and complete, and validate its effects through extensive evaluations on realistic perturbations. To our knowledge, this is the first study to certify the robustness of large-scale, keypoint-based pose estimation given images in real-world scenarios.",

Automated morphology analysis of a high number of sperm requires accurate segmentation of each sperm part and quantitative morphology evaluation. State-of-the-art instance-aware part segmentation networks follow a \"detect-then-segment\" paradigm. However, due to sperm's slim shape, their segmentation suffers from large context loss and feature distortion due to bounding box cropping and resizing during ROI Align. Moreover, morphology measurement of sperm tail is demanding because of the long and curved shape and its uneven width. This paper presents automated techniques to measure sperm morphology parameters automatically and quantitatively. A novel attention-based instance-aware part segmentation network is designed to reconstruct lost contexts outside bounding boxes and to fix distorted features, by refining preliminary segmented masks through merging features extracted by feature pyramid network. An automated centerline-based tail morphology measurement method is also proposed, in which an outlier filtering method and endpoint detection algorithm are designed to accurately reconstruct tail endpoints. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed network outperformed the state-of-the-art top-down RP-R-CNN by 9.2% [AP]_vol^p, and the proposed automated tail morphology measurement method achieved high measurement accuracies of 95.34%,96.39%,91.2% for length, width and curvature, respectively.",

        "abstract": "Recent text-guided generation of individual 3D object has achieved great success using diffusion priors. However, these methods are not suitable for object insertion and replacement tasks as they do not consider the background, leading to illumination mismatches within the environment. To bridge the gap, we introduce an illumination-aware 3D scene editing pipeline for 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) representation. Our key observation is that inpainting by the state-of-the-art conditional 2D diffusion model is consistent with background in lighting. To leverage the prior knowledge from the well-trained diffusion models for 3D object generation, our approach employs a coarse-to-fine objection optimization pipeline with inpainted views. In the first coarse step, we achieve image-to-3D lifting given an ideal inpainted view. The process employs 3D-aware diffusion prior from a view-conditioned diffusion model, which preserves illumination present in the conditioning image. To acquire an ideal inpainted image, we introduce an Anchor View Proposal (AVP) algorithm to find a single view that best represents the scene illumination in target region. In the second Texture Enhancement step, we introduce a novel Depth-guided Inpainting Score Distillation Sampling (DI-SDS), which enhances geometry and texture details with the inpainting diffusion prior, beyond the scope of the 3D-aware diffusion prior knowledge in the first coarse step. DI-SDS not only provides fine-grained texture enhancement, but also urges optimization to respect scene lighting. Our approach efficiently achieves local editing with global illumination consistency without explicitly modeling light transport. We demonstrate robustness of our method by evaluating editing in real scenes containing explicit highlight and shadows, and compare against the state-of-the-art text-to-3D editing methods.",

In many areas, including the medical domain, approaches relying on data sharing have become critical to address those challenges. While effective in increasing dataset size and diversity, data sharing raises significant privacy concerns. Commonly employed anonymization methods based on the k-anonymity paradigm often fail to preserve data diversity, affecting model robustness. This work introduces a novel approach using Conditional Variational Autoencoders (CVAEs) trained on feature vectors extracted from large pre-trained vision foundation models. Foundation models effectively detect and represent complex patterns across diverse domains, allowing the CVAE to faithfully capture the embedding space of a given data distribution to generate (sample) a diverse, privacy-respecting, and potentially unbounded set of synthetic feature vectors. Our method notably outperforms traditional approaches in both medical and natural image domains, exhibiting greater dataset diversity and higher robustness against perturbations while preserving sample privacy.
